The emphasis of the special issue is on recognition, discovery, and detection of topics and real-world events, as well as on monitoring and prediction of trends and events using social media sites as sensors. Both theoretical contributions and applications validated on larges-cale social media datasets are welcome.<br />

- Data mining and knowledge extraction from social media<br />
- Community detection and clustering in social media<br />
- Spatio-temporal analysis for event discovery and detection<br />
- Social media applications for prediction and monitoring<br />
