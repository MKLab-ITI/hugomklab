<div>MKLab is happy to announce that we received support from the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/academic_hw_seeding">Hardware Grant Program</a> of the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA Corporation</a> to continue our research (Zampoglou et al., 2015) on the field of multimedia forensics, which is currently carried out in the context of the <a href="http://revealproject.eu/">REVEAL</a> EC co-funded project. In particular, we are going to explore the potential of employing Deep Learning approaches on the problem of image splicing detection.&nbsp;</div>
