<p>The <a href="http://www.homer-project.eu/" target="_blank">HOMER</a>&nbsp;South East European RoadShow Event was held in Thessaloniki, Greece on December 15, 20016, co-organized by MKLab (ITI-CERTH), South-East European Research Centre and the Bulgarian Defense Institute. During the event the achievements of the HOMER consortium were presented to law enforcement and security agencies from South East Europe focusing on demonstrating the Homemade Explosive (HME) Discovery Tools and the HME Knowledge Management Platform (KMP).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">The event welcomed about 30 law enforcement and security agents representing several organizations across South East Europe, including Interpol, the Hellenic Police, the Hellenic Ministry of Defense, the Bulgarian Army, the Bulgarian Police, the Cyprus Police, the Romanian Armed Forces, the FYROM Ministry of Interior, the Bulgarian Ministry of Defense, the Serbian Ministry of Defense, the Albanian Police, the Bosnian Police and the UK Embassy in Greece. The event proved a great opportunity for informing the law enforcement community of South East Europe about the outcomes of the <a href="http://www.homer-project.eu/" target="_blank">HOMER </a>project and the feedback received was very encouraging. Several officers expressed their interest in utilizing and testing the KMP and the HME discovery tools within their operational environment, so as to evaluate their usefulness based on real scenarios and possibly integrate them within their everyday activities.</span></p>
