<p>The European Commission, the European Space Agency and NEREUS – the Network of European Regions Using Space Technologies published a collection of articles which document, for a non-specialist audience, the growing capabilities of European regions to benefit from Copernicus Sentinel data and information.</p>
  
<p>This collection provides an updated snapshot of how Copernicus is being used, primarily by public authorities at local and regional levels. The current publication portrays 99 Copernicus user stories submitted by authors from almost all of the Copernicus Participating Countries.</p>

<p>The MKLab team has published the article "A space-based solution for oil spill detection" that describes an innovative application that collects satellite images of the sea and detects areas polluted from oil releases in order to notify the national authorities and coast guards.</p>
