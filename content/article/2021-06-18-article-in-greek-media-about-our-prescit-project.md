<p>An article about the PrescIT project, coordinated by our lab, published in Greek media, explains its aspiring goals and process.</p>
<p>PrescIT aims to transform and expedite the workflow of medical experts by providing a smart, personalized and interoperable e-Prescription Platform. In detail, will enhance the current e-Prescription practices with:
<ul>
<li>Intelligence, by leveraging Big Data on drugs, disease and therapeutic protocols to advise and alert doctors in case of Drug Adverse Reactions (ADRs) and undesired Drug-to-Drug Interactions (DDIs)</li>
<li>Personalization, by combining information from the patient's Electronic Health Records (EHR) to provide recommendations</li>
<li>Interoperability, by integrating with Hospital Management Systems (HMS), private practice software and most importantly, the national prescription system in Greece, e-prescription.gr (<a href="http://www.e-syntagografisi.gr/" target="blank">e-syntagografisi.gr</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>End-users include healthcare professionals of all tiers and sectors that use e-presctiption services and pilots are planned in public and private hospitals in Greece after the first year.</p>
<p>Co‐financed by the European Regional Development Fund of the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH – CREATE - INNOVATE (project code:Τ1EDK-00640)</p>
