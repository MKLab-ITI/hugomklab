<h2>
<span>Motivation and Scope</span></h2>
<p>
<span>
BOEMIE 2008 focuses on the automation of the process of knowledge acquisition 
from multimedia content, using evolving multimedia ontologies for the extraction 
of information from multimedia content in networked sources. The goal is to 
develop synergistic approaches that combine multimedia extraction and ontology 
evolution in a bootstrapping process involving, on the one hand, the continuous 
extraction of semantic information from multimedia content in order to populate 
and enrich the ontologies and, on the other hand, the deployment of these 
ontologies to enhance the robustness of the extraction process.</span>
</p>
The workshop includes a number of invited talks grouped in sessions according to the following main research topics:
<ol>
	<li>Introduction to the workshop and the BOEMIE project </li>
	<li>Multimedia information extraction </li>
	<li>  Multimedia ontologies </li>
	<li>  Multimedia reasoning </li>
	<li>  Ontology learning and evolution </li>
</ol>
Each session includes a talk related to technologies developed in the BOEMIE project, as well as one additional talk from people involved in related research
projects and initiatives. A panel discussion will follow between the main invited speakers along with an open discussion with all participants.
