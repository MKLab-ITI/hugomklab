title: WaterMM Task at MediaEval 2021

<p>MKLab in cooperation with the Eastern Alps River Basin District invites you to the “WaterMM: Water Quality in Social Multimedia” task at MediaEval 2021, a multimedia evaluation benchmark that is dedicated to evaluating new algorithms for multimedia access and retrieval.</p>

<p>The WaterMM task deals with the analysis of social media posts from Twitter concerning issues of water quality, safety and security. Because the occurrence of words/phrases about the quality of drinking water (e.g., strange color, smell or taste, related illnesses, etc.) in a tweet might not necessarily reflect a case of water contamination, participants are asked to build a binary classification system that will be able to distinguish whether a post is relevant or not to water-quality issues. Participants can tackle the problem by using textual information, visual information, metadata or a combination of the above.</p>

<p>The dataset of the task is bilingual (English and Italian) and it has been collected and manually annotated in the frame of H2020 aqua3S, PathoCERT, and WQeMS projects</p>
