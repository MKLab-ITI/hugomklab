Researchers from MKLab are the winners of the first task of the [Find-it! Fraud Detection Contest](http://findit.univ-lr.fr/)! 
The contest task called for approaches to detect documents containing at least one forgery in a flow of documents.
The documents contained in the task dataset comprise 1969 scans of receipts. 

The MKLab researchers set up a system based on image steganographic features, a bag of SVM classifiers and class-rebalancing during training.
Using the training set provided by the organizers, this system managed to detect all forged documents without any error, achieving an F-score of 1.0.

More details on the results are available on the [contest website](http://findit.univ-lr.fr/results/).
