You can visit the new site to: a) Get informed about the updated list of features, explaining also how they are used to facilitate the service model of ImproveMyCity (Report - Administer - Analyze), b) Interact with a fully functional Live Demo where anyone can have a “hands on” experience of the Reporting, Administration &amp; Analytics services offered by the platform, c) Witness ImproveMyCity going global through a map that shows all active installations around the world (linking to the original websites), and d) Get a price for a number of additional tools and services that can leverage the ImproveMyCity experience. All tools and services are outlined with their corresponding price and a package builder can help you to select the desired features, calculating the total price automatically.</p>
