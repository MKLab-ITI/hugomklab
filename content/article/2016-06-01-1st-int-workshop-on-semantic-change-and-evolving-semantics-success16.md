<p><strong>1st Int. Workshop on “Semantic Change &amp; Evolving Semantics - SuCCESS’16"</strong></p>
<p>Leipzig, Germany, 12 September 2016</p>
<p>Website:&nbsp;<a href="http://pericles-project.eu/events/58">http://pericles-project.eu/events/58</a></p>
<p>In conjunction with the 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;International Conference on Semantic Systems –&nbsp;<a href="http://2016.semantics.cc/" target="_blank">SEMANTiCS 2016</a></p>
<p>The proceedings of the workshop will be published in the digital library of the ACM ICP Series.</p>
<p><strong>Workshop objectives</strong></p>
<p>This half-day workshop aims at exploring emerging research in the areas of semantic change and evolving semantics. Semantics differ across contexts, domains, communities and time. This has implications for communication, terminology, access to and exchange of information, problem-solving and construction of knowledge. Where there is interaction and feedback, this effect is mitigated, as it is possible to settle on a shared understanding; in contrast, the effect is particularly pronounced in asynchronous and static information. This problem is shared across many domains; some examples of areas in which the effect is particularly pronounced include cultural heritage, data curation, digital preservation, and knowledge management. One practical example is the need to respond to semantic change in ontology curation and engineering; another is the capture and treatment of context in search indexing and ranking. In this workshop we will focus on semantic change in these domains and closely aligned areas. As such, we expect the workshop to be of interest to researchers with an interest in combining techniques to address evolving semantics. We are therefore seeking expressions of interest in the workshop intended to explore this area and to collect together a series of perspectives on the theory and relevance of semantic change across contexts and disciplines.</p>
