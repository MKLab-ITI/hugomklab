<p>CERTH-ITI successfully participated in the Social Event Detection task of the MediaEval 2011 workshop. <a href="http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2011/">MediaEval</a>, a workshop focused on focused evaluation tasks with respect to multimedia analysis,&nbsp;took place in Pisa, Italy (1-2 September 2011). CERTH took part in the <a href="http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2011/SED2011/">Social Event Detection</a> (SED) task that involved two challenges: (a) detection of soccer events in two major European cities, (b) detection of events taking place in two specific venues. Both challenges were defined on a large set of about 75000 images from Flickr. A more detailed definition of the task is available <a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/mklab_people/papadop/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=conf:2011:papadopoulos_sed_me11overview.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>In the first challenge, CERTH achieved the best results, while in the second one its performance was close to the median.&nbsp;The approach employed by CERTH is described <a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/mklab_people/papadop/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=conf:2011:papadopoulos_sed_certh_me11wn.pdf">here</a>, while the presentation given at the workshop is embedded below.
