<p>ÎœKLab participated in The Video Retrieval Competition 2024, with the VERGE system, an interactive video content retrieval system designed for browsing a collection of images extracted from videos and conducting targeted content searches. VERGE incorporates a variety of retrieval methods and fusion techniques. It also offers a user-friendly web application for query formulation and displaying top results.

VBS is an international video content search competition that evaluates the state-of-the-art of interactive video retrieval systems. It is performed annually as a special session at the International Conference on MultiMedia Modeling (MMM) since 2012. 

The competition aims to push research on large-scale video retrieval systems that are effective, fast, and easy to use for content search scenarios that are truly relevant in practice (e.g., known-item search in an ever-increasing video archive, as nowadays ubiquitous in many domains of our digital world).
Our team ranked 5th in the Novice Session, 8th in the Expert Session and 7th overall among 16 participating teams.
