<p>MKLab had a very successful participation in the <a href="http://multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2015/">2015 edition of the MediaEval</a> benchmarking activity that took place in Wurzen, Germany on 14-15 September. The team participated in four tasks: <a href="http://multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2015/placing2015/">Placing</a>, <a href="http://multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2015/diverseimages2015/">Diverse Social Image Retrieval</a>, <a href="http://multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2015/verifyingmultimediause/">Verifying Multimedia Use</a>, and <a href="http://multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2015/eventsync2015/">Synchronization of Multi-User Event Media</a>, with the last two tasks being co-organized by members of the lab. The team achieved impressive results in two of the tasks, namely the Placing Task, in which it <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sympapadopoulos/certhcea-list-at-mediaeval-placing-task-2015">achieved the best performance</a>, being the only participation to outperform the system provided by the organizers, and in the Diverse Social Image Retrieval task, where the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sympapadopoulos/finding-diverse-social-images-at-mediaeval-2015">team achieved the best performance</a> in the single-topic queries, and the second best performance overall.&nbsp;</p>
