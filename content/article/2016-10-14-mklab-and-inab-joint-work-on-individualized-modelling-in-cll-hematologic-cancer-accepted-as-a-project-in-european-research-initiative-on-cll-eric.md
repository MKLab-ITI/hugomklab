<p><a href="http://www.ericll.org">ERIC</a>, the European Reasearch Initiative on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia&nbsp;(CLL), has accepted our joint <a href="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/126/23/2921?sso-checked=true">work</a> with the <a href="http://inab.certh.gr/">Institute of Applied Bioscience (INAB)</a>&nbsp;on individualized modelling of CLL patients, presented at <a href="http://www.hematology.org/Annual-Meeting/">ASH</a> 2015 [1]. Our objective in this work was to compare the performance of standard prognostic models in CLL (Cox regression models), novel machine learning models and clinicians' prognosis in predicting the Time-To-First-Treatment (TTFT) for each patient. ERIC accepted our work as an <a href="http://www.ericll.org/pages/projects/eric_proposal/%21">ongoing project</a> with the objective to promote it to trained hematologists in order to obtain a large set of educated predictions with respect to TTFT.&nbsp;</p>
