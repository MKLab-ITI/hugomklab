Call for Participation: 3rd VideOlympics Showcase Event at ACM CIVR '09
<br />

<hr />
<br />
ACM International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval (ACM CIVR'09)
<br />
July 8-10, 2009
<br />
Island of Santorini, Greece
<br />
<a href="http://www.civr2009.org/" class="moz-txt-link-freetext">http://www.civr2009.org</a>
<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
Demo sessions of video retrieval systems are ideal venues to disseminate
<br />
scientific results. Existing demo sessions, however, fail to engage the
<br />
audience fully. Real-time evaluation of several video retrieval systems in
<br />
a single showcase increases impact. Encouraged by the success of previous
<br />
editions, we will again organize a VideOlympics showcase at the 2009 ACM
<br />
International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval.
<br />
<br />
The major aim of the VideOlympics is to promote research in video
<br />
retrieval research. An additional main goal of the VideOlympics is giving
<br />
the audience a good perspective on the possibilities and limitations of
<br />
the current state-of-the-art systems. Where traditional evaluation
<br />
campaigns like TRECVID focus primarily on the effectiveness of collected
<br />
retrieval results, the VideOlympics also allows to take into account the
<br />
influence of interaction mechanisms and the advanced visualizations in the
<br />
interface. Specifically, we aim for a showcase that goes beyond the
<br />
regular demo session: it should be fun to do for the participants and fun
<br />
to watch for the conference audience. For all these reasons, the
<br />
VideOlympics should only have winners. Similar to last year, a number of
<br />
TRECVID participants will simultaneously do an *interactive search task*
<br />
during the VideOlympics showcase event. See the video trailer available at
<br />
<a href="http://www.videolympics.org/" class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated">www.VideOlympics.org</a> for an impression of the event.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />
New in 2009
<br />
<hr />
<br />
For the first time, we will include in the 2009 edition of the VideOlympics
<br />
a round with <strong class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>novice<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></strong> users, in addition to the round with expert users.
<br />
The novice users will be selected from a group of high-school teenagers from
<br />
the island of Santorini, for whom it can be assumed that they have a decent
<br />
English language level. Moreover it is allowed to provide each novice user
<br />
with a short training session with your video search engine (amount to be
<br />
defined).
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />
Setup
<br />
<hr />
<br />
We will be working with TRECVID 2008 test data (100 hrs of broadcast TV
<br />
news, documentaries, and educational programming) from the Netherlands
<br />
Institute for Sound and Vision. Text-only search topics will be revealed
<br />
during the showcase, similar in spirit to those used in several editions
<br />
of the TRECVID interactive search tasks, e.g.:
<br />
<br />
* Find shots of traffic signs
<br />
* Fins shots of a meeting with a large table and people visible
<br />
* Find shots of a daytime demonstration or protest with at least part
<br />
of one building visible
<br />
<br />
In contrast to TRECVID's interactive search task, where results are
<br />
submitted at the end of the search session, results should be submitted
<br />
immediately after they are found (see our protocol). Thus encouraging
<br />
quick retrieval of relevant results as well as unique results not found by
<br />
others. Note that the main aim of the VideOlympics is giving the audience
<br />
a good perspective on the possibilities and limitations of the current
<br />
state-of-the-art systems. Results are not meant for publication, but for
<br />
winning the <strong class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>Golden Retriever<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></strong> awards. Golden Retrievers will be awarded
<br />
for:
<br />
<br />
* Best performer
<br />
* Most impressive interface
<br />
* The public's favorite
<br />
* The one the public could use
<br />
* ...
<br />
<br />
In summary, the VideOlympics will only have winners.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />
Constraints
<br />
<hr />
<br />
* Only one system per team can be connected to the scoreboard
<br />
* Your interactive systems should work on at least one laptop, with all
<br />
relevant TRECVID 2008 test data on board.
<br />
* Your interactive system can not use on-line information extraction from
<br />
the Internet.
<br />
* We provide the protocol and software for a simple submit system of
<br />
results (check: <a href="http://www.videolympics.org/" class="moz-txt-link-freetext">http://www.VideOlympics.org</a>).
<br />
<br />
<br />
<hr />
Participation
<br />
<hr />
<br />
If you would like to participate in the VideOlympics Showcase, send an
<br />
email to: <a href="mailto:submit@videolympics.org" class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated">submit@videolympics.org</a> before February 1, 2009.
<br />
<br />
Please include the following:
<br />
<br />
* A 1-page description of your video search engine, possibly including a
<br />
screen shot, formatted in PDF using the camera-ready templates available at
<br />
<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates/" class="moz-txt-link-freetext">http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates/</a>
<br />
<br />
* Indicate whether you will participate in the novice and/or expert round.
<br />
* 3 possible text-only search topics of varying complexity (NOT similar to
<br />
existing TRECVID 2007/2008 topics).
<br />
<br />
All system descriptions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 referees.
<br />
Criteria for selection are novelty, uniqueness, and potential for audience
<br />
involvement. If your system is accepted, you are required to provide
<br />
ground truth annotation for 1 of your submitted search topics (the topic
<br />
will be selected by the organization).
