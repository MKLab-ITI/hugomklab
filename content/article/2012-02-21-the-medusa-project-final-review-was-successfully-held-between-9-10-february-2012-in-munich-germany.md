<p>The <a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/content/medusa">MEDUSA</a> project final review was successfully held between 9-10 February 2012 in Munich, Germany.</p><p>The MEDUSA project studies a combination of different types of sensors supporting operations within urban environments. The project analyzes a diverse cross-section of existing imaging sensor technologies including those in the field of video, with specific reference to images on visible and infrared bands. Multimedia Group&#39;s contribution to MEDUSA was two-fold, in visual processing algorithms and in the High Level Fusion (HLF) engine of MEDUSA with the development of the reasoning engine. Multimedia Group researched and developed real time algorithms that work on streaming video data for smoke detection and unusual motion detection (<a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/content/medusa">see them in action in the videos</a>).</p>
