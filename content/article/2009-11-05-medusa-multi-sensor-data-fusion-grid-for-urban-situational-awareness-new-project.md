The MEDUSA project, funded by the European Defense Agency (EDA), has started. The project is aiming to study a combination of different types of sensors for supporting operations within urban environments. ITI's contribution to the project will be in the area of data fusion algorithms, video processing and semantic analysis.

<!--break-->The essential improvement that the MEDUSA project will be implementing
is the provision of a means to address major existing capability
shortfalls: (i) in the fusion of data from multiple diverse types of
sensors and (ii) in the data representation, by means of a consolidated
and integrated view, including overlaying across 3D GIS (Geographical
Information System) models to facilitate decision-making by commanders
of control and support operations.
