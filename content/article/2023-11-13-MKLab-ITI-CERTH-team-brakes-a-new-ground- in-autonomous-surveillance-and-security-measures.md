On November 8, 2023, the Information Technologies Institute (ITI) of Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH) was honored to host the General Secretary of the General Secretariat for Research & Innovation (GSRI), Athanasios Kyriazis. A key highlight of Kyriazis's visit was a comprehensive demonstration of a groundbreaking remote surveillance system for an autonomous swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with enhanced cognitive capabilities.</p>

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;">The operator has the capacity to determine the number of UAVs to deploy and set various parameters such as speed, camera angle, and more. Leveraging advanced AI algorithms, the system estimates the most efficient flight pathways for each drone, ensuring effective area coverage.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The showcase system allows an operator to designate a surveillance area on a map, which could be located at any world point.</strong></p>

</figure>
&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;">Once the mission is approved by the operator, the UAVs autonomously take off from their remote location, conduct the surveillance operation, and return to their starting points, all without the need for local intervention. The system also includes state-of-the-art AI algorithms, which are capable of analyzing the visual feed from the UAVs in real-time, identifying objects of interest tailored to an operator’s needs and according to the application.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Mr. Kyriazis's experience with the system was met with great enthusiasm, and he provided valuable feedback, underscoring the potential for further advancements in this cutting-edge technology.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The successful demonstration to the General Secretary is a confirmation of the innovative spirit and collaborative efforts at CERTH, paving the way for a new era in autonomous surveillance and security measures.</p>
