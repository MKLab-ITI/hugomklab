SBOING™ and Informatics and Telematics Institute (ITI) of the Research and Technology-Hellas have agreed to investigate the development and evaluation of technologies for statistical analysis of large-scale navigation and tourism related data. 
</p><!--break-->
<p>
The objective is to extract useful information in order to offer advanced navigation and travel services by analysing user contributed content. These technologies are being developed by SBOING and in the framework of the &quot;WeKnowIt – Emerging, Collective Intelligence for personal, organisational and social use Integrated Project&quot;, co-ordinated by ITI.

About SBOING™<br />
SBOING™ is a new approach to advanced navigation services by means of user collaboration, worldwide. We are putting together the most up-to-date pieces of the world map tagged with time variant road data and other attributes, by properly integrating user contributions (uploaded user traces) from all over the world. We are &quot;the new kid in town&quot; and hope to become the &quot;Advanced Routing Wikipedia&quot; of global GPS-based navigation!<br />

About ITI and WeKnowIt<br />
ITI is a research Institute, supported by the Greek Ministry of Education, Lifelong Learning and Religious Affairs and mostly by European, National and Industrial research grants. ITI is the co-ordinator of the &quot;WeKnowIt – Emerging, Collective Intelligence for personal, organisational and social use&quot; Integrated Project. WeKnowIt develops technologies for information extraction from user generated data available in Web 2.0 applications and sites, by exploiting multiple layers of intelligence from user-contributed content, which together constitute Collective Intelligence, a form of intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and competition among many individuals.
