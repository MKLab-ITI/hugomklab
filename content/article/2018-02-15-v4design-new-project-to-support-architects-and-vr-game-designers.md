MKLab coordinates the H2020 project [V4Design website](https://v4design.eu/), started in January 1st, 2018. V4Design aims at reusing and repurposing visual and textual content for inspiring architecture and virtual reality game (VR) designing.

Visual content analysis is performed through 3D reconstruction and modelling, localization of objects in visual data, automated extraction of aesthetics/style information and language understanding from visual and textual data. 3D objects are also enhanced with semantics and explanatory text descriptions. V4Design will develop a platform that provides architects and virtual reality game designers with innovative tools necessary to enhance and simplify the creative phase of the designing process.
