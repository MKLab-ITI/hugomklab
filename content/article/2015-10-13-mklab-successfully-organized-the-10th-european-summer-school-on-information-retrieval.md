<div>The school welcomed 51 participants, mainly postgraduate and doctoral students, with the majority coming from Europe, but there were also 3 students from the USA and Canada. Thanks to our generous sponsors, 25 scholarships covering the registration fees were offered to ESSIR 2015 participants: 22 scholarships were offered by the ELIAS (Evaluating Information Access Systems) ESF Research Networking Programme and 3 scholarships by the ACM Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (ACM SIGIR). The total number of attendees including participants, lecturers, organizers and volunteers was 81.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Both students and lecturers really enjoyed the summer school according to the results of an anonymous questionnaire that was circulated following the completion of the summer school. In particular, the 55.8% of the attendants gave an Excellent (5/5) overall rating to the summer school, 39.5% of them a “Very Good” (4/5) rating, and 4.7% a “Good” rating.</div>
