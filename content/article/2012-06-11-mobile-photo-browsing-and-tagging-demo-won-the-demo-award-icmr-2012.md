  from the level of a city, through the level of an area/neighbourhood, down to the
  level of a specific spot. This navigation mechanism combined with photo clustering,
  and a dual map-list viewing mechanism, makes possible the browsing of hundreds of

  on the screen caused by the large number of markers on the map, an adaptive clustering
  strategy is employed. In addition to the advanced browsing capabilities, the application
  enables users to import their personal photos from Flickr and to easily annotate
  them by propagating to them metadata (location, tags) from the currently viewed
  object (area, landmark). The application currently supports more than 30 cities
  worldwide.</p>'
