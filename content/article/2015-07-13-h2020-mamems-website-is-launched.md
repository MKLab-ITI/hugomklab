<p><span class="s1">The H2020 project MAMEM, started in May 1st, 2015, aims at </span>integrating people with disabilities back into society by endowing them with the critical skill of managing and authoring multimedia content using novel and more natural interface channels. These channels will be controlled by eye-movements and mental commands, significantly increasing the potential for communication and exchange in leisure and non-leisure context. MAMEM's website adopts a rather unconventional design with the intention to become the project's "living" demonstrator that can be operated in two modes: a) conventionally using the mouse and keyboard, b) unconventional using the visitorsâ€™ eyes and mind. Have a look at the website&nbsp;<span class="s1"><a href="http://www.mamem.eu/">here</a>.</span></p>
