<p>M4D/MKLab in cooperation with the Eastern Alps River Basin District invites you to the “DisasterMM: Multimedia Analysis of Disaster-Related Social Media Data” task at MediaEval 2022, a multimedia evaluation benchmark that is dedicated to evaluating new algorithms for multimedia access and retrieval.</p>
<p>The DisasterMM task concerns the multimedia analysis of social media data, specifically posts from the popular platform of Twitter, that relate to natural or manmade disasters; this year, in particular, the disaster of floods. The participants of this task are provided with a set of Tweet IDs in order to download textual as well as visual information and other metadata of tweets that have been selected with keyword-based search that involved words/phrases about flood. DisasterMM includes two subtasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevance Classification of Twitter Posts (RCTP): participants are asked to build a binary classification system that will be able to distinguish whether a tweet is relevant or not to flooding incidents.</li>
<li>Location Extraction from Twitter Texts (LETT): participants are asked to develop a named-entity recognition model in order to identify which words (or sequence of words) inside a tweet’s text refer to locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>For both subtasks, the datasets are in Italian language, so as to encourage researchers to move away from a focus on English, and have been manually annotated by native speakers.</p>
