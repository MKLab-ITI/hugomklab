<p>
MKLab in cooperation with the Alto Adriatico Water Authority (AAWA) is organizing the Flood-related Multimedia task at the MediaEval Multimedia Evaluation benchmark, an initiative that is dedicated to evaluating new algorithms for multimedia access and retrieval.
</p>
<p>
The task requires participants to build an information retrieval system or a classifier that is able to distinguish whether or not a tweet is relevant to a flooding event in an area of interest, in order to support flood disaster management. Participants can tackle the challenge using text features, image features, or a combination of both.
</p>
<p>
The dataset of the task, collected and annotated in the frame of <a href="https://beaware-project.eu/" target="blank">H2020 beAWARE</a>, <a href="https://eopen-project.eu/" target="blank">H2020 EOPEN</a> and <a href="https://aqua3s.eu/" target="blank">H2020 aqua3S</a> projects, consists of Italian-language tweets, motivated by the common flood events in the cities of the Eastern Alps partition in North-East Italy.
