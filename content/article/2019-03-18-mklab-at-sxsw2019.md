<p style="font-style: italic;">Between 9/3 and 11/3, we were at the South by Southwest (SXSW 2019) festival at Austin Texas, to present the WeVerify and InVID projects as part of the EU House at SXSW (EU@SXSW). It was an opportunity to demonstrate our work to a broad US-based audience, and to participate in the ongoing discussions about the hottest emerging issues in media and tech with some of the most important players in the field.

<p>The EU-funded InVID and WeVerify projects were featured prominently in this year’s South-By-Southwest Conference and Festival (SXSW2019) and the Multimedia Knowledge and Social Media Analytics Laboratory of CERTH-ITI was there to present them. Postdoctoral Associate Dr Markos Zampoglou was invited from MKLab, alongside Denis Teyssou from AFP, our partner in both InVID and WeVerify.

<p>The EU House at SXSW (<a href="https://euinaustin.org/" target="_blank">EU@SXSW</a>) was situated on the “Palm Door on 6th” building. The InVID/WeVerify presentation and demos consisted of a number of touch-screens where a simplified version of the InVID Plugin was run on a set of hand-picked real world examples. We were there to guide visitors through the use of the plugin, explain the results, and discuss the role and impact of the WeVerify project in a world where disinformation is becoming an increasingly worrying problem.</p>
