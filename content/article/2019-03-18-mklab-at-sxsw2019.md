<p style="font-style: italic;">Between 9/3 and 11/3, we were at the South by Southwest (SXSW 2019) festival at Austin Texas, to present the WeVerify and InVID projects as part of the EU House at SXSW (EU@SXSW). It was an opportunity to demonstrate our work to a broad US-based audience, and to participate in the ongoing discussions about the hottest emerging issues in media and tech with some of the most important players in the field.

<p>The EU-funded InVID and WeVerify projects were featured prominently in this year’s South-By-Southwest Conference and Festival (SXSW2019) and the Multimedia Knowledge and Social Media Analytics Laboratory of CERTH-ITI was there to present them. Postdoctoral Associate Dr Markos Zampoglou was invited from MKLab, alongside Denis Teyssou from AFP, our partner in both InVID and WeVerify.

<p>The EU House at SXSW (<a href="https://euinaustin.org/" target="_blank">EU@SXSW</a>) was situated on the “Palm Door on 6th” building. The InVID/WeVerify presentation and demos consisted of a number of touch-screens where a simplified version of the InVID Plugin was run on a set of hand-picked real world examples. We were there to guide visitors through the use of the plugin, explain the results, and discuss the role and impact of the WeVerify project in a world where disinformation is becoming an increasingly worrying problem.</p>

<p>Our presentations drew much attention from visitors of many different fields, most prominently from the tech and media industries. The forensics and keyframe analysis features provided by MKLab were a major point of discussion, since similar functionalities are not currently used on other publicly available verification tools. Overall, more than one hundred people came in contact with the demos and the presentations, hopefully broadening the user base of the applications.</p>

<p>However, SXSW 2019 also included a host of events, exhibitions and talks that were relevant to our work. To the extent that our schedule allowed, we tried to get in contact with the community and follow the hottest issues discussed. Some notable events included:</p>

<h3>AI and the future of journalism</h3>
<p>Meredith Broussard (New York University), Rubina Fillion (The Intercept), Elite Truong (The Washington Post), Emily Withrow (Quartz)</p>
