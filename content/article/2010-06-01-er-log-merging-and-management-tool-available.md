As a result, extensive manual effort is necessary in order to merge and align the incoming log entries in order to make them suitable for review. In addition, critical information for the incident under study, such as person names and locations, is also manually extracted. The WeKnowIt ER Log (WERL) Manager is a web-based application that facilitates the task of ER log merging and management by automatically merging and aligning multiple log files and extracting ER-relevant semantic information from log entry text. WERL makes use of the representation patterns of Event Model F in order to facilitate information sharing and reuse. Furthermore, WERL enables interactive exploration of the collected log files by means of temporal, location and semantic filters.</p>
