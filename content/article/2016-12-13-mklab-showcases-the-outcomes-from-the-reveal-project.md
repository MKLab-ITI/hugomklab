<p>The <a href="http://revealproject.eu/">REVEAL project</a> is nearing its end (official end date is 31 December 2016), and our team has <a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/resources/reveal/">a number of interesting results</a> to share with the community. The results are of interest for a number of applications related to news mining, social media retrieval and verification. In particular, we make available:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a comprehensive toolbox for image forensics along with a web-based user interface;</li>
	<li>a method and web user-interface for verifying tweets;</li>
	<li>a web service for automatically detecting images with disturbing content;</li>
	<li>a method for predicting the future popularity of reddit posts and YouTube videos;</li>
	<li>a method for classifying Twitter users based on their interactions with other users;</li>
	<li>a method for estimating the geographic location referred to by a piece of text;</li>
	<li>a method for automatically creating summaries from large collections of social media posts.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>All of our results are accompanied by open source code and in many cases by reference datasets that can be used as benchmarks. More details are available on <a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/resources/reveal/">this page</a>.</p>
