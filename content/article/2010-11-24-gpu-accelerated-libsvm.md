excerpt: <p>A GPU-accelerated implementation of LIBSVM was released. This is a modification
  of the original LIBSVM that exploits the CUDA framework to significantly reduce
  processing time while producing identical results. GPU-accelerated LIBSVM gives
  a performance gain depending on the size of the input data set; this gain increases
  significantly when considering large data sets. More details and the software can
  be downloaded from <a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/project/GPU-LIBSVM" target="_blank">http://mklab.iti.gr/project/GPU-LIBSVM</a></p>
