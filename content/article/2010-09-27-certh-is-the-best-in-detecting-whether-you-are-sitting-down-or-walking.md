<p>CERTH participated to the Semantic Indexing (SIN) Task of TRECVID 2010 with its video concept detectors. CERTH&rsquo;s concept detectors produced the best results, among the submissions made by all institutions participating to TRECVID (101 runs from 30 different institutions), for two of the concepts evaluated this year (&quot;walking&quot;, &quot;sitting down&quot;). The latest technical details on the approach that was developed and used for building these detectors are reported in the following publication: V. Mezaris, A. Dimou, I. Kompatsiaris, &quot;On the use of feature tracks for dynamic concept detection in video&quot;, Proc. IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2010), Hong Kong, China, September 2010.</p>
