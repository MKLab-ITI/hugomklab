<strong>ABOUT THE VENUE</strong><br />
<br />
Olympiada is on the north-east point of Chalkidiki. Tradition says that Olympiada was named after king Alexander&#39;s mother, Olympiada. Olympiada is on the Strimonikos Gulf and it&#39;s distance to Thessaloniki is about 80 km of easy driving. The new <a href="http://www.egnatia.gr/" target="_blank">Egnatia</a> motorway, is the largest and newest motorway in Greece, and connects Olympiada to many cities as well as to countries in the north borders of Greece. One km to the East of Olympiada you will find the ancient Stagira, the home town of the great philosopher Aristotle. Olympiada is built at the side of a natural harbor. It is surrounded by a lot of magnificent beaches, green mountains and forests.<br />
<br />
<strong>ORGANIZATION</strong><br />
<br />
The IC1002 COST Action on Multilingual and Multifaceted Interactive Information Access (MUMIA) coordinates collaboration between researchers and professionals working on three key disciplines for the future of search: machine translation (MT), information retrieval (IR) and multifaceted interactive information access (MIIA).<br />
