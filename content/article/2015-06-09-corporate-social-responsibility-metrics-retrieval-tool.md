<p>We are making available a new <a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/wikirate-sandbox2/">demo</a> for the extraction of Corporate Responsibility Metrics in companies. The tool, which has been developed in the context of the <a href="http://wikirate.eu/">Wikirate project</a>, exploits information extraction techniques to fetch articles and metrics from relevant websites concerning the corporate sustainability practices of thousands of companies. As many as 17,000 articles have been retrieved for 7,000 companies in the Human Rights domain, while 57,000 metrics were extracted regarding their Corporate Responsibility behaviour. The tool is able to show all relevant articles extracted regarding a specific company and a topic of interest. Moreover the user can efficiently explore the content through interactive visualisations showing dominant connections among the content, author, country, topic and companies. The services behind the tool are being used in order to automatically populate with content the <a href="http://wikirate.org/">Wikirate platform</a> for crowdsourcing better companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tool is available <a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/wikirate-sandbox2/">here</a>.</p>
