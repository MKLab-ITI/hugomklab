<p>
The Multimedia Knowledge and Social Media Analytics Laboratory (<a href="https://mklab.iti.gr/" target="blank">MKLab</a>) of the Centre for Research & Technology Hellas (CERTH) participates and contributes actively in the <a href="https://sec3r.com/" target="blank">Security Research Rapid Response Platform</a> (sec3r.com) and the efforts to combat COVID19 by developing a web-based application to monitor, analyse and visualise social media posts related to the Coronavirus pandemic. The <a href="http://beaware-server.mklab.iti.gr:3000/" target="blank">Social Media Visualisation Tool</a> (beaware-server.mklab.iti.gr:3000) collects tweets with the hashtags <b>#covid19Italy</b> and <b>#covid19italia</b>, focusing on the region of Italy. 
</p>
<p>
The advanced analytical processes enable to geo-localise the captured tweets, extract the visual content from their images as well as estimate their severity. The outcomes of the analysis are propagated and visualised to a user-friendly and interactive interface facilitating civil protection authorities and other stakeholders from the health sector to monitor and extract valuable and actionable information concerning the evolution of COVID19 outbreak. This in-house application is motivated by the basic ideas and aspects of various EU funded projects, such as <a href="https://beaware-project.eu/" target="blank">H2020 beAWARE</a>, <a href="https://eopen-project.eu/" target="blank">H2020 EOPEN</a>, <a href="https://aqua3s.eu/" target="blank">H2020 aqua3S</a> that the MKLab leads or actively participates in.
