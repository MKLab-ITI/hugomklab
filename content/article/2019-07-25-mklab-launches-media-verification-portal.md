<p>In MKLab, we have been very active in recent years in the area of media-based online disinformation, conducting research in tools and technologies that help detect, study and combat online disinformation. In order to be more effective in spreading the word about our latest activities and results in this area, we have recently launched MeVer, the Media Verification team <a href="https://mever.iti.gr/" target="_blank">[website]</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/meverteam" target="_blank">[Twitter account]</a>. We plan to keep them updated with our recent progress, our results (tools, code, datasets) and experiences (e.g. event participation, etc.). </p>
