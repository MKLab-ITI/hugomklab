Aiming to enhance the research activity in the field of oil spill detection, the Multimedia Knowledge and Social Media Analytics Laboratory (MKLab) has developed the <b>Oil Spill Detection Dataset</b>, a dataset containing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images depicting oil spills and other relevant instances. Current dataset is part of our research work presented in the paper entitled as “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/15/1762" target="blank">Oil spill identification from satellite images using deep neural networks</a>” and could be beneficial for remote sensing applications mostly. The dataset is available to the research community through a specific access request  process. Currently, more than 50 institutions and organizations have utilized the Oil Spill Detection Dataset in research projects, which among of them are:
<ul>
<li><b>Greenpeace UK</b> – Development of an automatic oil spill detection tool based on SAR data with a web interface.</li>
<li><b>National Space Science Agency</b> - Automatic monitoring system for oil spill detection in the Arabian gulf area</li>
<li><b>University of Minnesota</b> - Detecting oil spills on water surfaces using deep learning.</li>
<li><b>Polytechnic University of Catalonia</b> - Oil Spill detection on SAR image with mintree representation and machine learning</li>
<li><b>National Technical University of Athens</b> - Automatic detection of oil pollution from remote sensing data in the Mediterranean Sea</li>
</ul>
