Nowadays, the proliferation of content due to the internet penetration and the easy creation of user-generated content have raised the need for the research and development of efficient search and retrieval techniques. Depending on the application, there is a need for the research and development of information retrieval techniques that deal with browsing and search of heterogeneous multimedia, web search and crawling, multimodal fusion of information, as well as knowledge extraction.

In this context MKLab exhibits research in the following directions of information retrieval with a special emphasis on multimedia:

- Implementation of interactive multimedia retrieval search engines with advanced visualization interfaces for exploratory search and browsing that combine content and visual concept-based retrieval methods. Applications on patent image search and generic content image and video retrieval.
- Research and development of multimodal search techniques based on fusion of multiple modalities by employing supervised machine learning and reranking techniques.
- Topic and event detection for indexing and retrieval based on machine learning techniques.
- Research and development of domain-specific search techniques based on query rewriting, expansion, web crawling and supervised machine learning. Application on environmental and forensic data.
- Research on question answering techniques based on passage retrieval and semantic knowledge extraction for the development of multilingual dialogue systems.
