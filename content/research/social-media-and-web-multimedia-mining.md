The pervasive use of Online Social Networks (OSN) for networking, communication and search in tandem with the ubiquitous availability of smartphones, which enables real-time multimedia capturing and sharing, have led to massive amounts of user-generated content and activities being amassed online, and made publicly available for analysis and mining. Leveraging large amounts of user-generated content creates new exciting possibilities for a number of applications and services such as search and forecasting. Yet, processing such content involves facing a number of hard challenges stemming from its scale and nature, while there are also a number of important caveats when dealing with user-generated content, such as the inference and disclosure of personal information. As a result, conventional multimedia analysis methods are not sufficient to extract value from social media and web content. To this end, MKLab develops methods to tackle a number of pertinent problems:

- efficient processing and indexing algorithms that can handle massive amounts of content;
- distributed and streaming data management frameworks to deal with the real-time nature of social media content;
- novel retrieval models that take into account both relevance and diversity;
- intuitive and engaging visualizations and dashboards that capture and summarize the key topics and interactions of online communities;
- machine learning frameworks that help uncover malicious and false user-generated information;
- graph-based algorithms that analyze the social context and interactions among OSN users;
- privacy-oriented data management frameworks that help OSN users gain awareness and control with respect to personal information disclosure and privacy risks;
- social media-powered applications that leverage social media content for improving performance in a given task, e.g. predicting the election result.
