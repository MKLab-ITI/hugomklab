Collective Awareness Platforms for Sustainability and Social Innovation (CAPS) are ICT systems leveraging the emerging “network effect” by combining open data, information gleaned from social media, distributed knowledge creation and data from real environments (“Internet of Things”) in order to create awareness of problems and possible solutions requesting collective efforts, enabling new forms of social innovation. CAPS is part of the research priorities of the Horizon 2020 research programme of the European Commission and was also part of the last FP7 research programme. MKLab is strongly involved in this area, with two successful projects from the FP7 call (USEMP, WikiRate) and three from the latest HORIZON2020 CAPS call (hackAIR, ChainReact, PROFIT), where the success rate was only 12%.

MKLab related expertise lies in the following areas among others:

- Reputation-based incentive mechanisms to motivate the participation of users in CAPS platforms,
- Provision of personalised recommendations and decision support to the platform users,
- Domain-specific search for data and web resources tailored to the domains of interest (e.g. environment, health, economy)
- Development of social media monitoring modules and open data crawlers for retrieving data related to a variety of domains of interest (e.g., from environmental stations, financial websites, etc.),
- Semantic integration and fusion of data from real environments (IoT) and OSNs
- Analysis algorithms that enable the inference of personal and potentially sensitive information from a variety of data that OSN users share,
- Visualization and interaction with massive amounts of complex data,
- Techniques for automated quality assurance of Web content and data through sophisticated data analysis approaches,
- Semantic reasoning over semantically integrated data for content enrichment
