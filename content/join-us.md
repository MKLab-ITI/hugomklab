We are running a significant number of <a href="https://mklab.iti.gr/projects/" target="_blank">research and innovation projects</a> advancing the state of the art, and we are also constantly looking into opportunities to explore new research areas and apply <a href="https://mklab.iti.gr/research/" target="_blank">our research</a> to more sectors.
