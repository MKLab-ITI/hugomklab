The REBECCA project aspires to tap into the potential of
Real-world Data (RWD) for supporting groundbreaking clinical research on
complex chronic conditions (CCC) as a complement to Randomised
Controlled Trials (RCT). REBECCA moves beyond the analysis of Electronic
health records (EHR), by combining it with detailed monitoring data from
multiple wearable, online behaviour and registry data to monitor
patients’ functional, emotional and Quality of Life trajectories, with
high temporal granularity. REBECCA also proposes explainable causal
modelling combined with deep learning to account for observed and latent
confounders in RWD analysis. The project focuses on the complex array of
chronic comorbidities developed during breast cancer recovery, in
particular studying the impact of primary and adjuvant cancer treatment
on patients’ quality of life and assessing the value of detailed
patient monitoring as a means for improved patient care, but will also
demonstrate the extensibility of REBECCA to other forms of cancer.
To this end, a total of seven studies in Sweden, Norway and Spain will
produce new knowledge on clinical management of cancer patients that
will shape future guidelines and practices for post-cancer treatments.
Best practices resulting from the REBECCA studies will be disseminated
to researchers, public health and regulatory bodies throughout Europe to
facilitate wider adoption of RWD in clinical research. In addition, the
REBECCA platform, capable of detailed monitoring and privacy-preserving
federated cross-country data analysis, will provide an infrastructure
for continued progress on use of RWD beyond the end of the project.
Through these activities, REBECCA aims at the mass adoption of RWD for
understanding CCCs and ultimately at establishing RWD as a valuable
clinical research and patient management tool.</p>
