<p>
Thessaloniki is a modern city with a long history, where the past and the present coexist in a unique way. One of the most emblematic monuments of the city is the Galerian Complex, which includes different monuments (palace with thrones and auditoriums, peristyles and baths, hippodrome, temple, triumphal arch, etc.) that now coexist with the modern buildings of the city. Ideally, a tour of the Galerian Complex should combine the observation of building remains with an experiential way that will allow the visitor to become acquainted with both the historical and social context to which they belong and the process by which they came to light.

<p>
The cardinal objective of the e-SKAPANI project is the utilization of the latest developments in the field of 3D capturing & digitization, as well as in the field of virtual and augmented reality, with the aim of developing innovative tools for the diagnosis, maintenance, documentation and promotion of Galerian monuments and artifacts, as well as the virtual connection of the Archaeological Museum with the Complex, but also the city itself. These tools will support the development of demonstration facilities and applications by promoting a multi-level cultural experience in the form of city walks and Museum visits.
