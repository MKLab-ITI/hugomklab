<p>echoPACS: Collection, processing and imaging of Ultrasound and Elastography images for the diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic approach of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The project aims in the development of a specialized software acting as medical workstation allowing the connection of different sources of ultrasound elastography images and data. The workstation will get input from medical devices in accordance to international standards like HL7 and DICOM. The processing data will be mainly consist of shearwave ultrasound sets. Moreover, for easier and more accurate data processing, various imaging features will be supported like image processing algorithms for automated area measuring. The integration of these algorithms will provide tools to assist benchmarking thus will contribute to faster export results and get statistical analysis and medical conclusions.</p>
