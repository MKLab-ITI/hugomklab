  For Advanced Search, Retrieval, Annotation and Description of Visual Data, <a href=http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ict/IC1307>COST
  Action IC1307</a>, is designed to bring together two previously unconnected research
  communities, Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).  It is
  set up to allow researchers to meet, exchange ideas, expertise and technology, and
  form new partnerships.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the successful EPSRC Network on Vision
  and Language (V&L Net), the aim of the COST Action is to create a lasting interdisciplinary
  research community situated at the nexus between language processing and computer
  vision. This is hugely important because of the explosive growth of visual and textual
  data (both on the World Wide Web and held in private repositories by diverse institutions
  and companies).\r\n"
