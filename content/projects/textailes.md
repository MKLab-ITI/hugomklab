The goal of TEXTaiLES is to redefine the digitisation of Cultural Heritage (CH) textile objects and develop AI-based processing tools, aiming to establish a standardised protocol integrated into the ECCCH. By studying past and present practices in textile digitisation, TEXTaiLES methodically explores their strengths and limitations. This comprehensive assessment, enriched by contributions from co-designer groups across various use cases, helps identify the essentials of textile digitisation. TEXTaiLES' approach to standardisation is all-encompassing, developing advanced tools that address the entire digitisation lifecycle of textile objects, focusing on non-destructive methods. Using robotic, cost-effective multi-sensor solutions, TEXTaiLES ensures the preservation of artefacts during digitisation, complemented by reliable data analysis workflows. It further specialises in motion modelling, dynamics, and the reconstruction of fragmented or lost objects. The project aims to embed the tools and techniques developed within its timeframe into archaeological research, facilitated by the ECCCH.

MKLab is responsible for developing a 4D digital twin platform enhanced by human-in-loop interactions, which will facilitate the virtual inspection and remote examination of CH textile artefacts. Moreover, it will deploy an automatic restoration tool for the digital reconstruction of fragmented or damaged artefacts using computer vision and generative algorithms.
