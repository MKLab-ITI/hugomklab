<p>K-Space: Knowledge Space of Semantic Inference for Automatic Annotation and Retrieval of Multimedia Content, 6th FP IST NoE, 2006-2008. K-Space will create a sustainable network of world-leading research teams from academia and industry to conduct integrative research and dissemination activities in semantic inference for automatic and semi-automatic annotation and retrieval of multimedia content, aiming at closing the gap between the low-level content descriptions that can be computed automatically by a machine and the richness and subjectivity of semantics in high-level human interpretations of audiovisual media. Specifically, K-Space integrative research will focus on three key areas: Content-based multimedia analysis; Knowledge extraction; and Semantic multimedia.</p>
<p>To ensure that the output of the targeted research becomes the primary feeding ground for industrial innovation, an Industrial Advisory Board with a core of four key industrial players has been set up and has been consulted from the very outset of proposal building. Its mission is to assist the network in defining research directions and to advise on potential exploitation of research results as they emerge. Specific dissemination objectives:</p>
<ul>
	<li>issemination of the technical developments of the network across the broad research community</li>
	<li>Delivering the means to bring the results beyond the research community in a way that appeals to the EU citizen</li>
	<li>Enabling the non specialist multimedia user to fehttp://www.mesh-ip.eu/edback into the K-Space technological framework</li>
	<li>Influencing and contributing to related knowledge-based multimedia standardisation activities</li>
</ul>
