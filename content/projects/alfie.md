The ALFIE project will create an interconnected ecosystem where legal discussions translate into actionable guidelines and are subsequently implemented through an advanced, ethical, and transparent Artificial Intelligence (AI) toolset. ALFIE combines advanced AI technology with ethical standards, ensuring that the resulting AI systems are not only high-performing but also fair, transparent, and free from bias. The project focuses on building two key components:
</p>
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li> <b>EthiTech Dialogue Hub (ETD-Hub):</b> A platform for dialogue and collaboration where AI experts, policymakers, legal professionals, and citizens can discuss and shape the ethical and legal aspects of AI. This platform will serve as a hub for exchanging ideas, understanding societal needs, and defining policies that ensure AI technologies are used responsibly.</li>
<li> <b>AutoML Platform:</b> A platform designed to allow users to easily create machine and deep learning models, even without technical expertise. This platform will prioritise ethics and compliance with European Union regulations, helping to ensure that AI models are fair, transparent, and trustworthy.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The platform will automate much of the machine learning process, from selecting algorithms to tuning models, making AI more accessible to a broader audience.
</p>
<p>
MKLab is responsible for two key components of the AutoML platform, the AutoDW (Data Warehouse) and the explainable AI (XAI) capability. The AutoDW is the central data hub for the AutoML platform and its main functionalities including integration with AI on demand platforms for search and retrieval of datasets to train AI models, data pre-processing and storing. The XAI component aims to make AI systems transparent, providing insights into how AI models make decisions. Within ALFIE, XAI will provide explanations in natural language to the users for the created AI models.
