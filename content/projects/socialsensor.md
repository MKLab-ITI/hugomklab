<p><a href="http://socialsensor.iti.gr/" target="_blank">SocialSensor</a>: <span class="green">SocialSensor</span> will develop a new framework for enabling real-time multimedia indexing and search in the Social Web. The project will move beyond conventional text-based indexing and retrieval models by mining and aggregating user inputs and content over multiple social networking sites. Social Indexing will incorporate information about the structure and activity of the usersâ€™ social network directly into the multimedia analysis and search process. <span class="green">Furthermore</span>, it will enhance the multimedia consumption experience by developing novel user-centric media visualization and browsing paradigms. For example, SocialSensor will analyse the dynamic and massive user contributions in order to extract unbiased trending topics and events and will use social connections for improved recommendations.</p>
<p><span class="green">To achieve</span> its objectives, SocialSensor introduces the concept of Dynamic Social COntainers (<acronym title="Dynamic Social COntainers">DySCOs</acronym>), a new layer of online multimedia content organisation with particular emphasis on the real-time, social and contextual nature of content and information consumption. Through the proposed <acronym title="Dynamic Social COntainers">DySCOs</acronym>-centered media search, SocialSensor will integrate social content mining, search and intelligent presentation in a personalized, context and network-aware way, based on aggregation and indexing of both UGC and multimedia Web content.</p>
<p><span class="green">The resulting</span> multimedia search system will be showcased and evaluated in two use cases: (a) news, involving professional news editors, journalists and casual readers, benefiting from the improved capabilities of SocialSensor for discovering new interesting social content and integrating it in the news creation and delivery lifecycle, and (b) infotainment, providing new multimedia search tools and unique media consumption experiences to attendants of large events (e.g. festivals). Providing real-time social indexing capabilities for both of these use cases is expected to have a transformational impact on both sectors.</p>
<p align="justify">The starting date of the project is October 1st, 2011.</p>
