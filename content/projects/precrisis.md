PRECRISIS aims to strengthen the protection of public spaces by preventing terrorist attacks and violent crimes and mitigating their impacts. It will promote integrated smarter innovative security through the empowerment of law enforcement authorities, first responders, local managers of public spaces and related security stakeholders, enhancing public-private cooperation. PRECRISIS will develop, test, and roll out innovative, sustainable, and effective AI-based digital solutions and practical toolkits, in full compliance with ethical standards and related legislation on the protection of personal data, by integrating existing expertise, best practices and privacy-by-design approaches to make public spaces more secure. 
</p>
<p>
Technological innovation delivered by the PRECRISIS Platform will provide identification of potential vulnerabilities connected to public spaces and a real-time simulation of plausible scenarios before, during and after terrorist attacks or severe violent incidents. The technology platform is complemented by the PRECRISIS Toolkit, delivering essential components for key stakeholders and providing the next generation of practical protective security tools for public spaces through a full range of policies, plans, training and exercising programmes. Taken together, the PRECRISIS Platform and Toolkit provide the essential system of collective measures needed to better protect public spaces from all manner of contemporary security hazards. 
</p>
<p>
PRECRISIS is delivered by a unique, multi-disciplinary consortium of 9 partners representing 7 EU member states, with a broad EU perspective. Combining a rich and diverse mix of expertise across the public space protective security landscape, the PRECRISIS partnership brings together an outstanding and internationally recognised team to deliver significant improvements to the protection of public spaces.

MKLab has a critical role in the project by leading the platform integration task, responsible for integrating the developed tools. In addition, MKLab leads the task related to the perceptions layer of the PRECRISIS platform, aiming to leverage computer vision and NLP techniques to analyse citizensâ€™ perception of terrorist and violent threats, as well as the feelings activated by the security environmental interventions. Finally, MKLab will contribute to activities related to the urban structures and public spaces vulnerability assessment and the modeling of crowd behaviour in reaction to several forms of severe violence and security interventions.
