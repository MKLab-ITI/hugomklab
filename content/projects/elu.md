excerpt: "ELU: Enhanced Learning Unlimited. The objective of Enhanced Learning Unlimited
  (ELU) is to look on how interactive digital TV can be used to increase learning
  opportunities in the home, office and school. The television is a familiar and reliable
  consumer device with around 95-99% penetration in European households. It is also
  perceived to be a source of learning. However, in its more traditional role it has
  tended to be used in a passive viewing mode.\r\n\r\n"
