  is bringing breaking news to online video platforms; and, news organisations delivering
  information by Web streams and TV broadcast often rely on user-generated recordings
  of breaking and developing news events shared by social media to illustrate the
  story. However, in video there is also deception. Access to increasingly sophisticated
  editing and content management tools, and the ease in which fake information spreads
  in electronic networks requires reputable news outlets to carefully verify third-party
  content before publishing it. InVID will build a platform providing services to
  detect, authenticate and check the reliability and accuracy of newsworthy video
  files and video content spread via social media.</div>'
