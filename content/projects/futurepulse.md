To serve the increasingly complex needs of the music ecosystem, FuturePulse will develop and pilot test a novel, close to market music platform in three high-impact use cases: a) Record Labels, b) Live Music, c) Online Music Platforms.

The project will help music companies leverage a variety of music data and content, ranging from broadcasters (TV, radio) and music streaming data, to sales statistics and streams of music-focused social media discussions, interactions and content, through sophisticated analytics and predictive modelling services to make highly informed business decisions, to better understand their audience and the music trends of the future, and ultimately to make music distribution more effective and profitable. FuturePulse will offer these capabilities over a user-friendly, highly intuitive and visual web solution that will enable the immersion of music professionals in the realm of music data, and will support them to make highly informed and effective business decisions.

MKLab as a department of the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH), Greece, participates in the project contributing its expertise on web and social media data collection and predictive modeling.
