Live+Gov: Reality Sensing, Mining and Augmentation for Mobile Citizen–eGovernment Dialogue, FP7 IST STREP, 2012-2015. Bringing policy makers closer to real life of citizens is the objective of Live+Gov. Live+Gov develops a mobile government solution that allows citizens to accurately express their needs to government by using a variety of mobile sensing technologies available in their smartphones (GPS; image/audio recording; compass, orientation sensors, etc.) next to established means of mobile eParticipation such as textual input and output. Sensing and mining data from the real world, such as geo-located images of street damages or GPS track recordings during traffic disruption, government achieves accurate analyses of citizens’ needs and opinions and can take advantage of a collective citizen intelligence.

Live+Gov develops novel policy models and links data contributions by citizens to existing administration processes. The Live+Gov key feature is that it fully exploits the capabilities of widely proliferated smartphones for mobile eParticipation, rendering an augmented reality of governmental actions and plans, such that citizens obtain fast and comprehensive feedback on issues they encounter. Anonymization, data randomization and access control will safeguard against misuse and ensure privacy for all involved. Live+Gov will be delivered in a Software-as-a-Service model packaging its fully developed software components such that take-up is possible at dramatically lower cost of operations. Success will be measured through three live field trials (mobility, urban maintenance, urban planning) conducted by partners already operating end-user platforms in these domains and reusing existing governmental data. The methodology, solution, and experiences made in field trials will be published through a combination of open source, public reports and open workshops. Field trials and exploitation is supported by a committed advisory board from four governmental institutions ensuring widespread take-up and long-term sustainability of the project results.
