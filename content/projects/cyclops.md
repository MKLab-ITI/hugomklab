The CYCLOPS project is dedicated to advancing data integration and management across diverse and evolving data sources. It directly aligns with the European Strategy for Data, aiming to cultivate a cohesive data market. CYCLOPS sets its sights on pivotal future EU data spaces: tourism and mobility, the green deal, public procurement, and manufacturing. These four (4) thematic areas form the core of CYCLOPS's mission to establish a groundbreaking framework for the comprehensive governance of the data lifecycle. Through the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Artificial Intelligence Operations (AIOps) and Data Operations (DataOps), augmented by Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and a human-in-the-loop approach, CYCLOPS strives to automate data processing pipelines. This approach is designed to eliminate data silos and promote interoperability in accordance with FAIR principles, ultimately fostering data sovereignty and spurring innovation within the EU.

MKLab, operating within Work Package 3 (WP3), assumes a leadership role, overseeing the entire package's management and coordination. This package encompasses the development of CYCLOPS's AIOps, DataOps, and Data and Execution Abstraction (DEA) modules. Beyond its managerial capacity, MKLab also directly contributes to the innovation and advancement of AIOps (T3.1) within WP3. Leveraging its expertise in multimodal data fusion, AI algorithms applied to Earth Observation, social media information, and data pipeline optimization, MKLab leads this task, driving the development of state-of-the-art AI solutions validating the projectâ€™s architecture across its 4 different thematic areas while also supporting strategic EU goals.
