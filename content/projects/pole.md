  &quot;Competitiveness&quot; 2000-2006. The current project focuses on the research,
  development of specific techniquesalgorithms and implementation of an integrated
  system/tool for the 3D reconstruction of the vessel's model from 2D IVUS images.
  The specified tool will be used for the blood flow simulation through the examined
  vessel and will also support the semi-automatic semantic image processing and  image
  annotation.\r\n"
