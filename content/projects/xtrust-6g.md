XTRUST-6G aims to establish a robust security framework for 6G ecosystems, grounded in the zero-trust security architecture and prioritizing resilience, privacy, and dependability. At its core, the project will implement dynamic access control through a context-aware, risk-based policy engine that leverages cyber-threat intelligence and behavioral insights from 6G infrastructure.

<p>  
The project will design proactive security tools for 5G+/6G networks, integrating real-time threat intelligence and foresight to enable early detection and response. It will enable AI-driven, zero-touch end-to-end protection for massively connected 6G ecosystems. Furthermore, XTRUST-6G will enhance visibility, real-time monitoring, and automated security orchestration in 5G+/6G. To ensure trustworthiness and regulatory compliance, the project will implement blockchain-based identity verification and decentralized trust management. It will also incorporate quantum-safe security solutions and AI-driven physical layer protection to enable quantum-resistant security in 6G backhaul and access networks. Lastly, XTRUST-6G will strengthen privacy and secure AI/ML-driven operations by privacy-preserving monitoring of virtualized network functions, applications, and cloud resources while ensuring fairness and transparency across the 6G security landscape.

MKLab is responsible for the overall coordination of the project and plays a critical role across its entirety. It leads the development of a novel framework for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of AI systems, while designing and executing the appropriate adversarial AI attacks. In addition, MKLab drives the development of a framework to manage cyber-threat intelligence tailored to the needs of the emerging 6G ecosystem.
