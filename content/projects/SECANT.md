<p>
The SECANT platform will enhance the capabilities of organisations’ stakeholders, implementing (a) collaborative threat intelligence collection, analysis and sharing; (b) innovative risk analysis specifically designed for interconnected nodes of an industrial ecosystem; (c) cutting-edge trust and accountability mechanisms for data protection and (d) security awareness training for more informed security choices. </p>
<p>
The proposed solution’s effectiveness and versatility will be validated in four realistic pilot use case scenarios applied in the healthcare ecosystem. Ultimately, SECANT will contribute decisively towards improving the readiness and resilience of the organisations against the crippling modern cyber-threats, increasing the privacy, data protection and accountability across the entire interconnected ICT ecosystem, and reducing the costs for security training in the European market.</p>
<p>
MKLab will be the technical coordinator & technology provider in SECANT and will thus lead tasks related to threat intelligence collection, sharing and reporting to CERT/CSIRTs, dynamic taxonomies for healthcare-related attacks and support their integration, verification and testing to the platform. </p>
<p>Additionally, MKLab will contribute to the identification of user and technical requirements as well as the overall system design and architecture definition. Furthermore, CERTH will contribute to the technical management, the integration with legacy systems and to the SECANT dashboard. </p>
<p>Finally, MKLab will be involved in the demonstration and evaluation of the SECANT platform on the three pilots and will contribute to the dissemination and communication of the results and the market analysis, business models and exploitation.</p>
