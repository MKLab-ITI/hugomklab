<p>The identification, classification and risk assessment of explosive devices such as unexploded ordinances (UXOs) and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), is of critical importance to NATO and its partners' strategic interests and tactical operations. </p>

<p>However, there are considerable challenges in doing so without specialised expertise present on the ground. VECTOR is going to provide an innovative solution that will enable real-time communication and collaboration between first responders and off-site experts via a multimedia capture application and a command and control dashboard. </p>

<p>By synthesising cutting-edge 3D photogrammetry, image recognition, data visualization, and augmented / virtual reality technology, VECTOR aims to go beyond the state-of-the-art to enhance explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operations against a wide range of threats.  </p>
