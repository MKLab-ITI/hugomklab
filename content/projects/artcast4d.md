<p>
Cultural and creative industries (CCI) marry the innovations of art and culture with the dissemination possibilities of commercialisation and industry. Immersive technologies are an important CCI tool. However, they tend to be expensive and impractical. Based on academic and industrial methods, the EU-funded Artcast4D project will exploit conceptual and exploratory research, open-source software and hardware advances to create ways to expedite European CCI. This will facilitate the creation of less expensive, more discreet interactive and immersive systems. Artcast4D will culminate in four bespoke pilots, uniting artists, industrial associates and the public. These will be supported by workshops and instruction for developers and artists. Ultimately, Artcast4D will underpin strategies for bolstering CCI competition and inventiveness in the EU.
