<p>
Uptake of IoT and AI driven ICT systems in Europe is crucial for our common future, but it is dependent on our strategic ability to protect these systems from cyber threats and attacks on their privacy. IRIS addresses this challenge with a collaborative-first approach centered around CERTs/CSIRTs. From a technological perspective, it deploys (i) autonomous detection of IoT and AI threats, enriched with (ii) privacy-aware intelligence sharing and collaboration, and (iii) advanced data protection and accountability. Crucially, IRIS introduces (iv) the first dedicated online training and cyber exercises to prepare CERTs/CSIRTs to collaboratively protect critical infrastructures and systems against cross-border AI and IoT threats. </p>
<p>
IRIS will be validated in three pilot demonstrators, focusing in the IoT, AI and cross-border dimensions, across three existing smart city environments (in Helsinki, Tallinn, and Barcelona), involving the associated national/governmental CERTs/CSIRTs, cybersecurity authorities and municipalities. The scenarios will contain real-life inspired cyber incidents that will build up into pilots at all levels (from local to national and to cross-border) to showcase the versatility of the IRIS solution. </p>
<p>
With 19 key partners from around Europe and 5 CERTs/CSIRTs as Associated Partners, IRIS’s solid consortium composition and work plan prioritises the effectiveness needed for quick real-world adoption and impact. Moreover, integration will be carried out on the EU’s existing MeliCERTes platform, with the support of INTRASOFT, while training will build upon THALES’s existing cyber range, and ECSO will ensure the contribution to standards and policymaking. With the formal support of the four H2020 Cybersecurity Competence Network Pilot Projects, IRIS will also actively engage with the full scope of the cybersecurity ecosystem in Europe.
</p>
<p>MKLab will be responsible for the research and development of technologies that can support the creation of dynamic repositories related to threats and vulnerabilities which target IoT and AI-driven ICT systems and will enrich this information with the use of taxonomies and ontologies. The employed taxonomies and ontologies will be based on and improve in a (semi)automatic way already existing IoT and AI related taxonomies and ontologies. Moreover, MKLab will be responsible for developing the dynamic policy framework and mechanisms for collaborative sharing and orchestration of cyber threat intelligence among CERTs, CSIRTs, and other stakeholders.
