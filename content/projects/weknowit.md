<p align="justify"><a href="http://weknowit.iti.gr" target="_blank">WeKnowIt</a>: The main objective of WeKnowIt is to develop novel techniques for exploiting multiple layers of intelligence from user-contributed content, which together constitute Collective Intelligence, a form of intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and competition among many individuals, and that seemingly has a mind of its own. To this end, input from various sources is analysed and combined: from digital content items and contextual information (Media Intelligence), massive user feedback (Mass Intelligence), and users social interaction (Social Intelligence) so as to benefit end-users (Personal Intelligence) and organisations (Organisational Intelligence).</p>
<p align="justify">The automatic generation of Collective Intelligence constitutes a departure from traditional methods for information sharing, since for example, semantic analysis has to fuse information from both the content itself and the social context, while at the same time the social dynamics have to be taken into account. Such intelligence provides added-value to the available content and renders existing procedures and workflows more efficient.</p>
