PERIVALLON aims to provide an improved and comprehensive intelligence picture of organised environmental crime and develop effective and efficient tools and solutions for detecting and preventing such types of criminal activities and for assessing their environmental impact based on geospatial intelligence, remote sensing, scanning, online monitoring, analysis, correlation, risk assessment, and predictive analytics technologies, by leveraging the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the fields of computer vision and multimodal analytics. As a result, enhanced investigation processes and methodologies will be derived through the capabilities provided by the developed tools and solutions, and the insights obtained though the proposed Environmental Crime Observatory. The capacity of end users (including Police Authorities and Border Guards) will also be improved and will enable them to tackle such criminal activities in an effective manner based on advanced tools and solutions and also on the innovative training curricula developed using physical and/or digital twins of relevant environmental crime scenarios. Moreover, improved international cooperation will be facilitated through improved data sharing enabled by blockchain technologies, while improved regulation shaping and tuning will be supported through relevant policy recommendations. PERIVALLON will be validated in field tests and demonstrations in four operational use cases. Extensive training, hands-on experience, joint exercises, and training material will boost the uptake of PERIVALLON tools and technologies. With a Consortium 5 Police and Border Guard Authorities, 3 authorities related to environmental protection, 6 Research/Academic institutions, 8 industry partners (including seven SMEs), one EU Agency, and one Foundation, PERIVALLON delivers a strong representation of the challenges, requirements and tools to meet its objectives.

MKLab is responsible for the management of scientific and technical aspects of the PERIVALLON project and has a critical role in the project by leading a WP on online monitoring activities for environmental crime detection, as well as tasks on multilingual text analysis, object detection in multimedia content, AI-based pattern recognition, trend detection, and predictive analytics. Moreover, MKLab contributes significantly to tasks on earth and aerial visual observation for water pollutants detection. The developed intelligent solutions for environmental crime detection cover computer vision analysis, online data mining, and multimodal and predictive analytics.
