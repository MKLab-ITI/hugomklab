<p><a href="http://cbp.iti.gr">CBP</a> : Cognitive Brain signal Processing lab, Aristeia I, 2012-2015. Vector field tomography, effective brain states and cognitive processes. "Cognitive Brain signal Processing lab - CBP" aims at advancing the state of the art in vector field tomography (VFT), by exploiting the new methodology in 2D and extending its theory to 3D. The Information Technologies Institute (ITI-CERTH) will benefit with the establishment of a new Lab (the CBP), which will be reinforced with a state of the art computer-based equipment for EEG.</p>
<p>As a result, a new activity will start in the ITI-CERTH on brain cognitive processes research, creating an interdisciplinary team of researchers with complementary skills that will utilize this equipment, in conjunction with VFT, but also with other state of the art techniques that will be explored, like connectivity analysis. This will enhance the links of the Institute with the Medical School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, by exploiting the options of using the developed methodologies developed by the team for direct communication with patients unable to verbalize their state of mind. The CBP will certainly advance the state of the art in vector field tomography on its own, but also as a tool to understanding cognitive processes in the brain, and in particular cognitive vision. It will also contribute to brain-computer interaction research, with the ultimate aim to be used for communicating with patients unable to communicate otherwise.</p>
