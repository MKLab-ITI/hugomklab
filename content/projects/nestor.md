NESTOR aims to demonstrate a fully functional next generation holistic border surveillance system providing pre-frontier situational awareness beyond maritime and land border following the concept of the European Integrated Border Management. NESTOR long-range, wide area surveillance capabilities for detection, recognition classification and tracking of moving targets (e.g. persons, vehicles, drones etc.) is based on optical, thermal imagine and Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum analysis fed by an interoperable long range IP-based network of sensors including stationary installations and mobile manned or unmanned aerial, water surface, underwater and ground vehicles, capable of functioning both as standalone, tethered and in swarms (UAV, USV, UUV and UGV) platforms. NESTOR Border Command Control and Coordination intelligence (BC3i) system using cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence and Risk Assessment technologies fuses in real-time the surveillance data in combination with analysis of web and social media data, sharing a pre-frontier intelligent picture to local, regional and national command center operators in AR environment.

CERTH is participating with two (2) complementary research groups: (i) M4D group from MKLab and (ii) ConvCAO. CERTH-MKLab group is responsible for the management and supervision of the scientific and technical outcomes of NESTOR, as well as the development of object recognition models for border surveillance based on optronic data and the development of fusion schemes. The CERTH-ConvCAO group is responsible for the development of UxV swarm commanding tolls and machine collaboration methodologies.
