<p><a href="http://www.homer-project.eu/">HOMER</a>: Homemade explosives (HMEs) and recipes characterisation- Capability. The goal of HOMER is to expand the knowledge of European bodies about Homemade Explosives (HME) and to improve the capacity of security and law enforcement agencies to cope with current and anticipated threats in order to reduce the probability that HMEs will be used by terrorists. The concept of the HOMER project is based on four pillars: a) data collection and analysis based on HME literature study, information mining from internet resources, industry best practices, as well as chemical and compound filtering analysis; b) knowledge management to support the sustainability of HME knowledge content; c) case study experiments and validation; d) standardization of HME vocabulary and definition among the security and law enforcement agencies and also the precursorâ€™s manufacturers, for the purpose of preventing, detecting and mitigating the threat resulting from the manufacture of HMEs by terrorist and criminal elements. ITI-CERTH will lead the discovery and analysis of HME recipes in the Web and will be involved in the knowledge management of HME resources.</p>
