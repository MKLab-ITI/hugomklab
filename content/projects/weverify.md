<p>WeVerifyâ€™s aim is to address the advanced content verification challenges through a participatory verification approach, open source algorithms, low-overhead human-in-the-loop machine learning and intuitive visualizations. Social media and web content will be analysed for detection of disinformation; contextualised within the broader social web and media ecosystem; and misleading and fabricated content will be exposed as such, both through micro-targeted debunking and a blockchain-based public database of known fakes.</p>

<p>A key outcome will be the WeVerify platform for collaborative, decentralised content verification, tracking, and debunking. The platform will be open source to engage communities and citizen journalists alongside newsroom and freelance journalists; to enable low-overhead integration with in-house content management systems; and to support both organisational deployments and a premium, web platform-as-a-service offering. It will be furthermore supplemented by a digital companion to assist with verification tasks.</p>
