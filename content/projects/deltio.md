<p><a href="http://www.atc.gr/deltio/">DELTIO</a>: Analysis of Multimedia Content using Evolutionary Ontologies and Application to Television News Bulletins, General Secretariat for Research and Technology, Infosociety, 2006-2007. Objective of the project is the development of innovative techniques for the representation, analysis and extraction of semantic information for the manipulation of multimedia content, with emphasis on their application to television news bulletins. Research and development will concentrate on techniques that enable the automatic analysis of multimedia content and the extraction of knowledge, resulting in the (semi-) automatic creation of metadata, as well as provide support for smart, semantic search services. The final output of the project will be a system for the analysis of television new bulletins, which will provide intelligent search functionalities in archives of digital television material.</p>
