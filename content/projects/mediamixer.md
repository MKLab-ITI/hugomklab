<p><a href="http://mediamixer.eu">MediaMixer</a>: Community set-up and networking for the remixing of online media fragments, FP7 ICT CSA, 2012-2014. MediaMixer will set up and sustain a community of video producers, hosters and redistributors who will be supported in the adoption of semantic multimedia technology in order to build an European market for media fragment re-purposing and re-selling. It will demonstrate the achievable benefits enabled by the creation, repurposing and reuse of digital contents across borders on the Web, where media fragments are intelligent digital objects, identified and classified at a highly granular degree, integrated with knowledge management, and connected at Web-scale.
