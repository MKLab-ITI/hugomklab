<p><a href="http://www.pericles-project.eu/">PERICLES</a>: (Promoting and Enhancing Reuse of Information throughout the Content&nbsp;Lifecycle taking account of Evolving Semantics) is an Integrated Project funded by the&nbsp;European Union under its Seventh Framework Programme (ICT Call 9). PERICLES is a four-year project that aims to address the challenge of ensuring that digital&nbsp;content remains accessible in an environment that is subject to continual change. This can&nbsp;encompass not only technological change, but also changes in semantics, academic or&nbsp;professional practice, or society itself, which can affect the attitudes and interests of the&nbsp;various stakeholders that interact with the content. PERICLES will take a ‘preservation by&nbsp;design’ approach that involves modelling, capturing and maintaining detailed and complex&nbsp;information about digital content, the environment in which it exists, and the processes and&nbsp;policies to which it is subject.</p>
<p>PERICLES will address these preservation challenges in two domains: digital artworks, such&nbsp;as interactive software-based installations, and other digital media from Tate's collections&nbsp;and archives; and experimental scientific data originating from the European Space Agency&nbsp;and International Space Station. The project will deliver two preservation prototypes, one&nbsp;for each of these domains, as well as a portfolio of models, services, tools and best practice&nbsp;for the support of preservation ecosystem and lifecycle management. Broader take-up&nbsp;of the project’s results will be encouraged through Communities of Practice and&nbsp;engagement with industry.</p>
<p>PERICLES is funded under FP7 ICT Call 9, and addresses work programme objective ICT-2011.4.3 Digital Preservation.</p>
