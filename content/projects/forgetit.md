<p><a href="http://www.forgetit-project.eu/">ForgetIT</a>: Concise Preservation by combining Managed Forgetting and Contextualized Remembering, FP7 ICT IP, 2013-2016. ForgetIT addresses current challenges in the area of multimedia preservation, in the personal and organizational context, by introducing three new concepts: i) Managed Forgetting, which is inspired by the important role of forgetting in human memory; ii) Synergetic Preservation, which crosses the chasm between active information use and preservation management; iii) Contextualized Remembering, which aims at keeping preserved content meaningful and useful along time. To achieve these goals, ForgetIT brings together a truly interdisciplinary team of experts. (Scientific Responsible: <a href="http://www.iti.gr/%7Ebmezaris">Vasileios Mezaris</a>).</p>
