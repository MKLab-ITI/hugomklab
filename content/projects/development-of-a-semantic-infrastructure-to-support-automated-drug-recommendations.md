<p>The project aims at developing a semantic repository of pharmaceutical knowledge regarding drug use and prescriptions. Ergobyte S.A. has developed a comprehensive online pharmaceutical lexicon which enables medical practitioners to conveniently have on screen a complete list of information regarding drug use which includes details like indications, contraindications, adverse effects and drug interactions.</p><p>The purpose of the project is to transform this database into a semantic knowledge base using OWL ontologies and enrich it using semantic rules. Thus inference and reasoning will be enabled in order to exploit hidden implicit knowledge which will further enhance the capabilities of the system so as to be able to perform recommendations of drug prescriptions according to patient data. The benefits of such an approach are numerous with the most important being the minimization of prescription errors, the reduction of cost for drugs for the insurance companies and agencies and the correct prescription dosage which is evaluated in combination of patient condition, age, sex and medical record data. Ergobyte S.A. is benefited by offering an enhanced product with functionalities that few other have in the local market, thus having the potential to enlarge their customer base.</p>
