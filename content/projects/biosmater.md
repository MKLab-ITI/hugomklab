The BIOS MATER aims to develop and demonstrate advanced bio-based construction products and building elements with tailored functional properties such as durability, fire resistance, water barriers, acoustic and thermal insulation, lightweight structure, mechanical strength, and antimicrobial features, ensuring safety and sustainability. At the core of the concept are the four Production routes which are built around four pillars. Specifically: Production route A will focus on the development of bio-based core products and sandwich structure for flooring applications, Production route B will focus on the development of bio-based wall panels and flooring tiles, Production route C will focus on the development of fiber reinforced bio-resin composite panels applied as exterior fa√ßade cladding panels and Production route D will focus on the development of biodegradable and plantable bio-based tiles from foams applied as drywall panels. Moreover, the four pillars are: Pillar 1. Innovation in bio-based construction and building product development; Pillar 2. Health, safety, and environmental impact through Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD), Pillar 3. Circular economy integration and scalability and Pillar: 4 Driving market adoption of bio-based products through digital transparency, stakeholder engagement, and social acceptability. Key elements include life cycle assessments (LCA), circularity, and SSbD assessments. BIOS MATER will test and demonstrate the compatibility of these products with existing construction practices and regulatory frameworks at the controlled real-world application of a DEMOpark. The project also incorporates stakeholder engagement, training, and awareness programs, with 22 partners from 10 EU countries working together to achieve these goals across 7 work packages.

MKLab is responsible for leading the development and implementation of an advanced data-sharing platform. This platform is designed to facilitate real-time monitoring and traceability of the bio-based construction products and elements across all four production routes of the project. A crucial aspect of this involves enhancing the transparency of material sourcing, processing, and lifecycle management, including the integration of a Digital Product Passport (DPP). Finally, the platform will incorporate an End-to-End Module to track products through all phases of their production cycle, with a focus on improving circularity, resource efficiency, and overall lifecycle management.
