The project "υποστιρίΖΩ" aims to develop a platform, based on intelligent collection and interpretation of IoT devices, to reliably monitor elderly and people with chronic illnesses, leading to more effective, more economical and more accessible remote care, as well as self-management of their illnesses, increasing their quality of life. By using a mobile application and in collaboration with other technology and telecoms providers, the project aims at spreading widely, with multiple social and economic benefits.
