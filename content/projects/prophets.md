PROPHETS will look at redefining new methods to prevent, investigate and mitigate cybercriminal behaviours through the development of a coherent, EU-wide, adaptive SECURITY MODEL, built upon the interplay of the human factors within the new cyber ecosystem and capable of addressing the four fundamental dimensions at the core of the phenomenon: (i) early identification of security threats; (ii) investigations within a new public-private governance; (iii) increased complexity of the response due to the expansion of the security perimeter towards new societal fields and the emergence of challenging jurisdictional problems; and, last but not least, (iv) perception of security and freedoms among citizens, which requires a new communication strategy for LEAs and security policy makers.
