VOLABIOS aims to transform the early detection and clinical management of schizophrenia (SZ) by leveraging innovative and real-time spectrograph technology to certify that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be utilized as non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers for the early detection of the disease. Underscoring the urgent need for accurate, accessible diagnostic tools, VOLABIOS will conduct large-scale prospective clinical studies involving 3,692 participants across six European centres and a blind validation cohort of 1,000 subjects. Special emphasis is placed on the longitudinal monitoring of individuals at high risk to identify VOC signatures that indicate early transition to SZ. In order to gain further insights and to strengthen the evidence supporting the use of VOCs, VOLABIOS integrates VOC detection with multi-omics analyses including genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics, supported by a biobank of approximately 4,000 biological samples and an extensive dataset comprising 9 million records. By combining biological data with environmental, personal, and lifestyle risk factors, the project aims to uncover complex mechanisms that contribute to SZ onset and progression. This integrated methodology is expected to increase predictive precision, enable earlier identification of disease onset, and support more effective clinical management. In parallel, VOLABIOS will carry out controlled in-vivo experiments in animal models that will elucidate the molecular and cellular pathways influenced by validated VOCs, providing essential mechanistic evidence. Through this comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach, VOLABIOS aspires to define EU-wide diagnostic protocols for SZ, enhance early detection, reduce misdiagnosis, and improve long-term patient outcomes. The project represents a significant advance in precision psychiatry and the broader effort to modernize mental healthcare across Europe.
