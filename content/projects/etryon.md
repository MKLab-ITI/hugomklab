The primary objective of eTryOn is to revolutionize the interaction between users (i.e. fashion designers and consumers) and fashion items, by researching and developing technologies that allow virtual tryons of garments. In this direction, the main research, innovation and technological endeavours of eTryOn are to develop technology for: a) generating personal photorealistic 3D avatars of the user, b) automatically simulating the interaction between 3D user avatars and digital garments (i.e. size fitting and visualization of interactions during body movements), and c) extracting fashion insights from user preference data and generating fashion recommendations. By combining the high-quality experience offered by photorealistic personal avatars, their natural interaction with virtual garments, and the accurate fashion insights/recommendations with the use of interactive technologies like Virtual/Augmented reality, eTryOn provides future interactive solutions for Human Fashion Interaction. More specifically, three interactive solutions will be developed: i) Creative fashion app: a VR application targeting fashion designers, facilitating them throughout the creative process of garment design by offering realistic fitting of the digital garments on photorealistic 3D avatars, ii) Social fashion app: a mobile application for social media users (e.g. influencers), allowing them to virtually change their outfit in an image/video by selecting from a pool of digital garments and then upload it to social media, and iii) ecommerce fashion app: a mobile-based AR magic mirror enabling virtual tryons of garments during online shopping that aims to recreate at home the experience of buying clothes from a physical store.
