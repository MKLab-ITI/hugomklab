<p><a href="http://www.mamem.eu">MAMEM</a> â€“ Multimedia Authoring and Management using your Eyes and Mind. MAMEM's goal is to integrate people with disabilities back into society by increasing their potential for communication and exchange in leisure (e.g. social networks) and non-leisure context (e.g. workplace). In this direction, MAMEM delivers the technology to enable human computer interfaces that can be controlled through eye-movements and mental commands. This is accomplished by extending the core API of current operating systems with advanced function calls, appropriate for accessing the signals captured by an eye-tracker, an EEG-recorder and bio-measurement sensors</p>
