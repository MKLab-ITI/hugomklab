<p>
The monitoring and management of natural and man-made disasters has been a great issue in the Adriatic-Ionian region, as justified in the programme document and also underlined in the relevant policies addressed (EUSAIR, Green Deal, S3, etc). More specifically, AINATURE will focus on the use of AI tools (and contemporary technologies) for the early detection and monitoring of three major challenges faced by ADRION countries:
</p>
<p>
- Pollution of open surface water resources and warning/monitoring of floods: through the adjustment of the AI tool developed in aqua3S and PathoCERT projects (H2020), the partners will be able to detect pollution and alterations in the water surface.
</p>
<p>
- Floods monitoring: through the adjustment of the AI tools developed in aqua3S project (H2020), the partners will be able to identify the flooded areas.
</p>
<p>
- Wildfires: through the adjustment of the AI tools developed in projects TREEADS and Silvanus (H2020).
</p>
<p>
The AI tools will be based on images available through the free sources identified in the aforementioned projects, along with crowdsourced data that we will collect through the dedicated mobile app.
</p>
<p>
The project's main action will be the implementation of pilot actions for the use of a joint AI system based on existing tools and software, which have been already elaborated and tested in previous projects (H2020), allowing for early detection and effective management of natural crises.
</p>
<p>
The technologies exploited in this effort will be based on:
</p>
<p>
- AI tools,
</p>
<p>
- BIG data extraction and analysis
</p>
<p>
- Mobile application
</p>
<p>
In this regard, the main outputs include:
</p>
<p>
- The development of an AI early warning and monitoring system that consists of:
</p>
<p>
1. An AI tool for the detection of pollution and other alterations in the surface of open water sources, including seawater, lakes, and streams.
</p>
<p>
2. An AI tool for the early detection and monitoring of wildfires.
</p>
<p>
3. An AI tool for the monitoring and detection of floods.
</p>
<p>
4. A mobile app, through which the citizens will be able to support the real time monitoring of a natural crisis.
</p>
<p>
5. A Platform that will include all tools, available for all partners to be informed, to compare conditions, to increase preparedness, and to improve the management of a crisis.
</p>
<p>
- The adjustment of existing AI tools to the data and information (available and requested) of the ADRION partners
</p>
<p>
- 6 Pilot cases on 3 different types of crises (fires, floods, and water pollution)
</p>
<p>
- a Joint Action Plan on the exploitation of the projectâ€™s outputs supported by nature-based solutions, aiming to facilitate the inclusion of/replicability of other interested bodies.

MKLAB is responsible for the scientific and technical management of the AINATURE project and has a critical role in the project by leading the WPs on the development and update of the platform and the AI tools.
