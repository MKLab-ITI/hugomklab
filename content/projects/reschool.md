<p>
The energy sector is responsible for 72 % of the EUâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions. Rapid and effective decarbonisation is urgently needed. Solutions include increasing the renewable energy share, ensuring efficient energy use and giving citizens a more active role in the energy value chain. In this context, the EU-funded RESCHOOL project will consider energy communities as a way to bring together and empower active consumers and prosumers as relevant energy stakeholders. The project will encourage citizen engagement, and facilitate their interaction with the grid as flexibility providers and their participation in electricity markets. RESCHOOL will deliver solutions and tools designed to support energy and flexibility management and interaction based on collaborative and gamification strategies.
