<p>The EU-funded RAISE project aims to address the challenge of an open, fair and reliable Research Community, where every researcher will be accredited for its work and all research data will be equally accessible for processing without violating data protection regulations. RAISE's vision is to provide the infrastructure for a distributed crowdsourced data processing system, moving from open data to open access data for processing. RAISE will design the mechanism for sending the algorithm to the dataset instead of sending the data to the algorithm. The success of such an application will provide to users a transparent way of processing and sharing data, enabling the research community to publish their outcomes with evidence-based authenticity of the data-analysis performed, ensuring at the same time the accreditation of researchersâ€™ work. </p>
 
<p>MKLab of the Information Technologies Institute of CERTH will contribute to the definition and development of an extensible, robust and rich data reference model for the targeted pilot application domains. In addition, will contribute to the development of the a) RAISE FAIR Catalogue and Portal for data discovery and b) synthetic data generation (SDG) engine that will analyse and pre-process the uploaded datasets.</p>
