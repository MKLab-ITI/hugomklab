The EU-funded ALAMEDA project aims to provide new opportunities for improved personalized healthcare and prevention that have been enabled by the recent advances in the design and development of Innovative health risk prediction and intervention tools. <b>ALAMEDA’s vision</b> is to research and prototype the next generation of personalized AI healthcare support systems for people with brain diseases and disorders, specifically focusing <b>on the needs of patients with Parkinson’s, Multiple Sclerosis and Stroke (PMSS)</b>. The project’s innovations will take advantage of new machine learning models, built upon lifestyle retrospective data as well as new streams of patient data that involve the monitoring of everyday activities, such as sleep behaviour and emotional status.
</p>
<p>
The success of such applications will provide clinicians with <b>the opportunity to modify interventions based on personalized data recordings</b>, that could include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic options, such as exercise regimens.
</p>
<p>
<b>MKLab</b> of the Information Technologies Institute of CERTH will contribe to the research and development of novel AI technologies for health as part of the consortium of ALAMEDA.
