The Smart-Water project is a research collaboration between the Thessaloniki Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EYATH), Apifon Telecommunications, and the Information Technologies Institute
(ITI) of the National Center For Research & Technology (CERTH) and focuses on the following objectives:
1) Designing an integrated prototype infrastructure for intelligent water system management that will use telemetry and remote control technologies to provide innovative services to the water company and the consumer.
2) Research and development of alternative technologies for the realization of the telemetering and remote control network with a real-life pilot test in the urban environment of Thessaloniki to evaluate the infrastructure's reliability and efficiency.
3) Research, development and pilot testing of a management system for data analysis and decision support, automatic detection of leakage incidents and generation of notification events, provision of personalized information to the consumer and automation of processes for the water company.
4) Evaluation of the overall infrastructure with criteria such as business performance, usability and reliability, economic benefit to the water company, user/consumer satisfaction and cost-effectiveness of the investment.
