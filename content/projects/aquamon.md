<p>
Urban water pollution, resulting from rapid urbanisation, industrialization, and climate change, poses a significant threat to public health and environmental impact, compromising water quality. Specifically, water quality deterioration is linked to diffuse pollution from pollutant surface and groundwater bodies, disrupting biodiversity and the quality of aquatic ecosystems while exacerbating the global water crisis. Traditional urban water management plans do not include a holistic monitoring approach to address emerging water pollution ignoring important water pollution sources and pathways. Detecting, preventing, and responding timely to these threats can ensure the preservation of clean and safe water sources and work towards a resilient and sustainable water future across Europe that prioritises both public health and environmental well-being.
</p>
<p>
By committing to the destination of a clean environment and zero pollution, AQUAMON aims to perform innovation activities towards:
<ul>
<li>Securing high-quality drinking water,</li>
<li>Integrating sewer and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) control,</li>
<li>Building a water-smart management system for bathing waters to provide informed and safe opportunities for bathing in urban recreational waters,</li>
<li>Restoring our oceans, seas, and river water bodies by deploying unmanned vehicles across the water surface, underwater, and air,</li>
<li>Enhance sustainability to elevate wastewater quality to reuse standards,</li>
<li>Improving urban water quality monitoring management plans and regulation shaping throughout the entire urban water cycle.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Designed around the challenges of 8 representative use cases across Europe, AQUAMON will implement effective monitoring strategies to enhance the comprehension of diffuse and point sources of water pollution within a global and climate change context.

MKLab will lead the development of key data analysis components for the AQUAMON project. In particular, MKLab will deliver a multimodal fusion engine that integrates diverse data sources—such as sensor readings, text, images, and video—into a unified and interactive representation of urban water sites. Furthermore, MKLab will develop an optronic-based tool to automatically identify and locate pollutants from visual data. This tool will provide crucial detection outcomes that will be integrated by the fusion engine, contributing to a comprehensive and immersive overview of water quality.
