<p>
Living labs are key to integrating research and innovation processes in real-life settings, and with a focus on people and their engagement in research procedures. To support these living labs, the EU-funded VITALISE project will develop ICT tools for shared access on similar devices and applications. It will also create a harmonisation body to proceed towards the harmonisation of procedures of health and well-being living labs. The ICT tools will also enable shared access of similar devices and applications used across living labs. By opening up living lab infrastructures, the project will help to promote research activities in the health and well-being domain in Europe and beyond.
