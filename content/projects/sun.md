<p>
The SUN Horizon Europe project aims at investigating and developing extended reality (XR) solutions that integrate the physical and the virtual world in a convincing way, from a human and social perspective. The virtual world will be a means to augment the physical world with new opportunities for social and human interaction.
</p>
<p>
Relevant limitations that will be addressed are:
<ul>
<li>•	Lack of solutions to develop scalable and cost-effective new XR applications.</li>
<li>•	Lack of convincing solutions for mixing of the virtual and physical environment.</li>
<li>•	Lack of plausible and convincing human interaction interfaces in XR.</li>
<li>•	Barriers due to resource limitations of end-user devices.</li>
</ul>
The SUN project develops solutions to surpass the aforementioned limitations, including:
<ul>
<li>•	Scalable solutions to obtain plausible and convincing virtual copies of physical objects and environments.</li>
•	Seamless and convincing interaction between the physical and the virtual world.</li>
•	Wearable sensors and haptic interfaces for convincing and natural interaction with the virtual environment.</li>
•	Artificial intelligence-based solutions to address current computing, memory, and network limitations of wearable devices.</li>
</ul>
The solutions will be demonstrated in three real-life scenarios, focusing on social interaction and collaboration:
<ol type="1">
<li>XR for rehabilitation after accidents or diseases.</li>
<li>XR in the industry to increase safety and improve social interaction among workers.</li>
<li>XR to remove interaction barriers for persons with disabilities.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
MKLab develops visual analysis tools (e.g. for pose estimation) as well as multimodal fusion techniques that combine different types of data (visual, sensors from wearables, etc.).
