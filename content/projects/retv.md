ReTV will advance the state of the art in video analysis, video augmentation and annotation, content and audience metrics, prediction and recommendation models, and visual analytics. The results of this research will be tested and validated together with a regional public broadcaster, a national TV archive and an OTT TV distributor operating in multiple EU markets. ReTV will offer them a better match between content and viewers across vectors, time and different EU languages. Automated re-purposing and more accurate targeting in terms of relevance and appropriate representation, tailored to upcoming events and specific vector audiences, will drive growth, lower costs, and increase the competitiveness of broadcasters and other professional stakeholders in European media value chains.
