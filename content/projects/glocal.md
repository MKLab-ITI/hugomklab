<p><a href="http://www.glocal-project.eu/" target="_blank">GLOCAL</a>: Event-based Retrieval of Networked Media, FP7 IST IP, 2009-2012. The key idea underlying GLOCAL is to use events as the primary means to organize and index media, e.g., photos, videos, journal articles. Instead of starting from media and seeing, a posteriori, how we can meaningfully understand their contents (e.g., by tagging them), we organize a priori our data and knowledge in terms of events and use media to populate them, thus providing their experiential dimension. Events provide the common framework inside which the local experience-driven contextual information can be not only coded, but also shared and reduced to a common denominator.
