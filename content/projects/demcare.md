<p><a href="http://www.demcare.eu/">Dem@Care</a> Dementia Ambient Care: Multi-Sensing Monitoring for Intelligent Remote Management and Decision Support, FP7 IST IP, 2011-2015. Dem@Care develops a remote care solution that will contribute to enhanced diagnosis and timely, personalised support of people with dementia by deepening the understanding of how the disease affects their everyday life and behaviour. It implements a closed-loop remote management solution that affords interactive feedback to the person with dementia, while at the same time including clinicians into the remote follow-up, enabling them to maintain a comprehensive view of the health status and progress of the affected person. More specifically Dem@Care includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a loop for people with dementia and their informal caregivers that: i) monitors and assesses their cognitive and behavioural status by integrating a multiplicity of wearable and in-situ sensors, ii) enables time evolving context-sensitive profiling to support reactive and proactive care, iii) provides personalised and adaptive feedback</li>
	<li>a professional loop that: i) provides objective observations regarding the health progression of the person with dementia and medication effectiveness, ii) warns about trends closely related to dementia (e.g. apathy), iii) supports preventive care decision making and adjustment of treatment recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>To&nbsp;alleviate the subjectivity of current clinical practises, while accounting for the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease, Dem@Care&nbsp;follows a multi-parametric behaviour interpretation approach deploying multiple sensors for monitoring daily activities, lifestyle patterns, speech impediments, state of mood, and vital signs. Clinical&nbsp;evaluation and validation will be&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;in three stages through&nbsp;pilots that will be carried out in Ireland, France and Sweden, in collaboration with regional clinics, residential care centres and health councils.</p>
