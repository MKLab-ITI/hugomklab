<p>
Advancements in technology have transformed the interactive experience of cultural heritage and its preservation. However, not everyone has access to such experiences, nor the opportunity to participate in the cultural and creative industries. In this context, the EU-funded MuseIT project aims to co-design, develop and co-evaluate cutting-edge technologies to facilitate and widen access to cultural assets in an inclusive way. It also aims to promote inclusion, participation, accessibility and equal opportunities for all by developing a multisensory, user-centred platform for remote immersive co-creative engagement with cultural assets and experiences.
