The i-Game project aims to create an accessible open-source game development platform that will facilitate the co-creation of games by diverse actors within different ecosystems of cultural and creative sectors and industries (CCSI), to enhance innovation and to bring positive impact on social cohesion and sustainability.

<p>  
More specifically, i-Game aspires: 1) To engage video game stakeholders of different abilities, expertise, and disciplines, to contribute, learn, share and tap into new innovative and economic opportunities; 2) To provide a collaborative platform with the tools to co-create mobile and virtual reality games by engaging different users, from different backgrounds and sectors; 3) To develop an ethical-design culture in the video game industry; 4) To monitor, assess and manage the impact that the video games have on different sectors, especially targeting culture/museums, creative industries and fashion/textile; 5) To help understand why and how are online games positively impacting people, culture and society and help extract the ingredients necessary for developing a new generation of games targeted to improve peopleâ€™s well-being.

MKLab is the coordinator of i-Game project. It will also contribute to technology development, with the responsibility of the implementation of the co-creation platform, the development of explainable AI modules (XAI) for game developers, and the integration of existing solutions. More specifically, it will be involved in creating a development workflow and integrating XAI into artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to ensure that game developers feel comfortable using advanced AI. Through the project, M4D will focus on creating interpretable models that provide transparent predictions.
