<p>SILVANUS envisages to deliver an environmentally sustainable and climate resilient forest management platform through innovative capabilities to prevent and combat against the ignition and spread of forest fires. The platform will cater to the demands of efficient resource utilisation and provide protection against threats of wildfires encountered globally. The project will establish synergies between (i) environmental; (ii) technology and (iii) social science experts for enhancing the ability of regional and national authorities to monitor forest resources, evaluate biodiversity, generate more accurate fire risk indicators and promote safety regulations among citizens through awareness campaigns. The novelty of SILVANUS lies in the development and integration of advanced semantic technologies to systematically formalise the knowledge of forest administration and resource utilisation. Additionally, the platform will integrate a big-data processing framework capable of analysing heterogeneous data sources including earth observation resources, climate models and weather data, continuous on-board computation of multi-spectral video streams. Also, the project integrates a series of sensor and actuator technologies using innovative wireless communication infrastructure through the coordination of aerial vehicles and ground robots.</p>
<p>MKLab, the participating team from CERTH, is responsible for leading a task on social media sensing and concept extraction. The task will focus on the collection of citizen observations from social media, in particular Twitter, about possible fire incidents, in order to contribute to early-stage detection of wildfires. In addition, location-related concepts and visual concepts, such as smoke, flames, etc., will be extracted from the textual and visual content of the social media posts, to gain more insight on potential fire events.</p>
