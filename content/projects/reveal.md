<p><a href="http://revealproject.eu/">REVEAL:</a> The project aims to advance the necessary technologies for making a higher level analysis of social media possible. The project will enable users to reveal hidden ‘modalities’ such as reputation, influence or credibility of information. However, a key problem: It takes a lot of effort to distinguish useful information from the ‘noise’ (e.g. useless or misleading information). REVEAL aims to discover higher level concepts hidden within information. Further to discovering what is being said, we will determine how trustworthy that information is. We will predict contributor impact and how much or to what extent all this affects reputation or influence. The core of our work is to reveal hidden modalities for the benefit of a better understanding and utilization of the Social Media world.</p>
