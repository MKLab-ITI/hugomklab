<p>The goal of the MIRROR project is to develop an integrated platform, a set of tools on top of this platform, as well as a systematic methodology for the comprehensive intermedia analysis of the perception of Europe (and individual countries in Europe), the detection of discrepancies between perception of and reality in Europe, and the creation of awareness for the impact of such misconceptions and potentially resulting threats. For achieving this goal the MIRROR project will bring together a highly interdisciplinary team of experts, and will combine methods of automated media analysis considering different types of media with empirical studies for creating a substantiated picture of the perception of Europe.
