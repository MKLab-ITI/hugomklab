<p><a href="http://www.ist-chorus.org">CHORUS</a>: Coordinated approacH to the EurOpean effoRt on aUdio-visual Search engines. CHORUS is a Coordination Action which aims at creating the conditions of mutual information and cross fertilisation between the projects that will run under Strategic objective 2.6.3 (Advanced search technologies for digital audio-visual content) and beyond the IST initiative. CHORUS workplan includes the set up of a coordination and information exchange platform (cluster meetings, newsletter, website) to enhance the interactions and to invoke discussions between the key players of the IST 'Cluster' and thus to stimulate the creation of the European Research Area (ERA).</p>
<p>An important task of the project consists of supporting the preparation of an analysis and a roadmap for the realisation of Audio-visual search engines in EU. That activity will need a multi-disciplinary (societal, economic, regulatory and technological) and strategic approach and will imply the participation of major Stakeholders of the domain through the creation of a Think-Tank. The Think Tank, to which several representative organizations have already agreed to participate, will contribute to give an industrial relevance to the coordination action and its visions. The areas a priori investigated by the project are described in WP2 activities.</p>
<p>Interaction and dissemination will be further ensured through the set-up of a conference and dedicated workshops addressing a large community which complement the coordination instruments proposed by CHORUS.</p>
