<p>PATExpert: Patents belong to the few types of public information that have a big impact on the European economy, and whose proper monitoring, retrieval, representation, interpretation, and assessment so clearly depend on the access to its content, and, thus, on advances in semantics-based techniques. However, research and development in the area of patent processing still focuses on selected traditional tasks such as text retrieval, classification, and shallow linguistic analysis. PATExpert's overall scientific objective is to change the paradigm currently followed for patent processing from textual (viewing patents as text blocks enriched by picture material that are interpreted as 'canned' material, sequences of morpho-syntactic tokens, or collections of syntactic structures) to semantic (viewing patents as multimedia knowledge objects) processing.</p>
<p>MKLab is closely collaborating with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Faculty of Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - AUTH and in particular with the Information Processing Laboratory (IPL) of AUTH, in the research activities that are carried out in the PATexpert project.</p>
