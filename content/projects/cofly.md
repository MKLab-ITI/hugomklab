<p>The main aim of CoFly project is to develop an operational framework for micro air vehicles (MAVs) that would be affordable and widely distributed in the marketplace. In addition, the main objective is to provide the entrepreneurs the ability to complete high precision manual labour operations with lesser cost and time-consuming way, meaning without the need of a MAV operator expert. Although a large variety of affordable MAV platforms is available, their majority offer limited control functionalities. Moreover, a wide spectrum of navigational sensors and computing systems, capable to be attached on a MAV, is also available. Thus, a MAV platform with advanced functionalities comprises the ultimate objective of the project, including an interactive navigation system as well as conceptual and autonomous decision-making abilities. The final product will increase business opportunities by removing technological barriers to the widespread use of MAVs platforms specifically in agricultural monitoring and precision agriculture tasks.</p>
