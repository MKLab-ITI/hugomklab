e-Vision builds on the latest impressive advancements of computer vision with the aim to improve the autonomy of people with visual impairment at both practical and emotional level. More specifically, it’s purpose is to develop an assistive system that will rely on visual information to recognize the objects and faces surrounding the user. The system will be supported by a set of sensors properly embedded to a pair of glasses for capturing the visual information and for transmitting the auditory messages. The evaluation of the system will be performed in the context of three pilot studies that will simulate a visit to the supermarket for buying groceries, a visit to the town hall for taking care administrative issues, and a visit to the promenade of Thessaloniki for recreation purposes and for participating in social gatherings.
