<p><a href="http://www.mumia-network.eu/">MUMIA</a>: Multilingual and Multifaceted Interactive Information Access, Cost Action IC1002. Multilingual and Multifaceted Interactive Information Access (MUMIA) research and development will be a key part of the next generation of search technology. Machine Translation (MT), Information Retrieval (IR) and Multifaceted Interactive Information Access (MIIA) are three disciplines which address the main components of MUMIA. This Action will launch a much needed initiative to coordinate the collaboration between these disciplines, fostering research and technology transfer in these areas and play an important role in the definition of the future of search. To form a common basis for collaboration, the domain of patent retrieval has been selected as it provides highly sophisticated and information intensive search tasks that have significant economic ramifications; as well as providing a large scale unifying test bed of multilingual and dynamic data. This Action will explore innovative frameworks to empower the synergies from the disparate research fields of MT/IR/MIIA within the specific context of patent search and other next generation Web applications.</p>
