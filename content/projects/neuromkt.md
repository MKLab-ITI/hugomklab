How do we communicate a (advertising) message? Is the message interesting to the recipient? Does the message tire the recipient? Does it cause negative or positive emotions? During the creation of an (advertising) message, the author / constructor of the message should respond to the above queries. In this project, we propose a multimodal and adaptive Brain-Computer Interface that will help us to answer, in part, the above questions. The BCI system will give us information about what a message communicate, the emotions it causes, if the message is interesting. Emotions play an important role in human knowledge, perception, decision making and interaction. Particularly, positive feelings can play a crucial role in the process of creating effective associations between the message and the recipient. Neuroscience helps us to decode (and study) these associations between the message and the recipient. The behavior and cognitive status of the recipient can be assessed, in part, by its "normal" responses, which can be measured by appropriate sensors. The objective of the project is the study and the creation of a Multimodal Brain-Computer Interface that will enable us to assess the Psycho-Emotional Status of the recipient. The assessment of the recipient's Psycho-Emotional Status can be achieved by monitoring the movement of his eyes and the electrical activity of the brain. The proposed interface is expected to have a significant impact on the areas of Advertising (/ Marketing) and Decision Making, as well as wider areas related to Public Policy Planning and Education.
