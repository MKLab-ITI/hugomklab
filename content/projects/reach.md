<p><a href="http://mklab-services.iti.gr/reach" target="_blank">REACH</a>: New Forms of Distributed Organization and Access to Cultural Heritage, General Secretariat for Research and Technology, Research and Technological Development Consortia in Sectors of National Priority - CULTURE. The overall aim of REACH is to provide a web portal enabling access to different databases of cultural content with emphasis on multimedia material. The objective is to use ontologies to provide enhanced unified access to heterogeneous distributed cultural heritage digital databases. In order to achieve this, the project employs ontology-based representation of cultural content, multimedia content-based search algorithms, hybrid ontology and content-based access and user-friendly search interfaces. This fusion approach provides users with resources for building queries of multimedia repositories sequentially using multiple individual search tools, and performs higher quality searching. The system will be tested using real content such as inscriptions and coins from the Greco-Roman time period.</p>
