The overall aim of SPICE  is to provide a new model of participatory co-creation in (re)shaping neighbourhoods. SPICE aspires to develop, test, and validate innovative community engagement approaches towards defining an evidence-based model to co-design, co-create, and maintain public spaces in four European neighbourhoods. By fostering transdisciplinary synergies and inclusive participation, leveraging cutting-edge digital tools, and promoting circular and regenerative construction practices, the project will address critical societal challenges, enhance social cohesion, highlight EU values such as democratic participation, diversity in cultures and languages, and social inclusion, and support the European Green Deal's objectives and New European Bauhaus (NEB) principles.

MKLab is the coordinator of the SPICE project and leads the Work Package on Digital Tools for Co-Creation, which constitutes the technological backbone of SPICE’s participatory and design-driven approach. This WP develops an integrated digital ecosystem that supports the co-creation process by combining advanced AI, XR, and citizen engagement tools to enable inclusive, data-informed, and creative urban transformations. Specifically, it involves the development of AI-based tools for 3D scene editing as well as the implementation of interactive digital services that enhance citizen participation in the co-creation of public spaces.
