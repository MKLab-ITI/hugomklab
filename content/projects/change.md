The vision of the project is to develop a complex multiparametric approach of changing attitude and behavior of the trip makers in urban areas, through the ICT usage and their applications. The challenge is twofold: from one side to replace the traditional option of private car usage with alternative modes such as the bicycle by promoting in parallel the common vision of sustainable transport, and from the other to gradually replace the ownership approach and philosophy with the new approach of shareship.
The ambition of the CHANGE project is to promote the role of bike sharing as a means of transport in urban areas, enhancing life quality, lowering carbon emissions, reducing the time spent on the road, accidents, etc. In addition, the project aspires to create a complete client-oriented Business Model Canvas for companies in the market by evaluating peer to peer accessibility-based business models.
