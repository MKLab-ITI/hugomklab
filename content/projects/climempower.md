<p>
ClimEmpower aims to empower five south-European regions with high Climate Change (CC) risk and exceptionally low adaptive capacity to enhance their CC-resilience, establish the regional Communities of Practice (CoP) and co-create the resilient development strategies adapted to the regional needs and potentials. To achieve this, ClimEmpower consortium will combine user-driven climate applications, capacity building and best practices transfer from other European projects and regions.

<p>
Throughout the project the ClimEmpower team will aid the regional administration in organizing the regional CoPs where representatives of "quadruple helix" stakeholders will discuss their Climate Adaptation needs and capabilities, assess potential pathways towards CC-resilient, societally just, and sustainable future and elect sustainable and CC-resilient regional development pathways that are best suited to their needs and capabilities. This activity will be supported by a) provision of the data driven Decision Support service(s) for strategic CC-adaptation planning, b) provision of easy to understand educational materials illustrating the CC risks and possible technological, natural and societal adaptation options and strategies, explaining the use of the project tools, and c)  knowledge transfer on existing data, tools and best practices in climate adaptation from successful EU projects and regions with higher adaptive capacity. ClimEmpower will develop a new generic interface to C3S Climate Data Store, data driven CC-hazard and -risk assessment services, and semi-quantitative (“screening”) services allowing the users to compare different adaptation strategies. These services will primarily rely on open data and open service infrastructure and on cross-linking of such data with data that can be sampled locally during the project - to complement the pan-European data, improve granularity or to validate the predictions.

MKLab participates in the technical implementation of several WP’s of the ClimEmpower project, either as a Task leader or as participant in several tasks. Specifically, MKLab is the task leader for collecting, analysing, and fusing data from different sources that are necessary for the realisation of the user-centric services for the ClimEmpower regions. To this end, MKLab will develop spatial downscaling methods for Copernicus Satellite images along with the automatic georeferencing of crowdsourced information from X (former twitter) or other social media that deem as appropriate. Also, MKLab is the task leader for developing Web-GUI application components and the GUI integration environment and participates in the development of the user-centric applications of the project. Furthermore, MKLab plays a critical role in the implementation of the Greek Trial scenario, as a Case Study Facilitator (CSF), that will be jointly implemented with the Regional Administration of Central Greece. As a CSF, MKLab participates in the formation and management of the Greek Community of Practice (CoP) which aims to establish a productive relationship between researchers and non-researchers that facilitates the dialogue and cooperation by building shared awareness and knowledge with the purpose to empower local actors by adapting CC resilient strategies and measure.
