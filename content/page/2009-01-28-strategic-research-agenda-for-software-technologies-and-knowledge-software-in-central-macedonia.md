The diffusion of Software Technologies through
enterprises and organizations has recently transformed the way of working,
communicating and organizing with remarkable positive impact in terms of
productivity. At the same time, research activities in the areas of Software Technologies and Knowledge Software have attracted considerable interest and mature
research results have already been applied in practice, while the future
promises even more astonishing results. This recent development and progressive
adoption of applications based on Knowledge Technologies by enterprises and
organizations is expected to bring new changes in the design and execution of
business activities, through the automation of many processes and the provision
of actionable information and knowledge to the users of such applications. The
new possibilities and benefits that will emerge from the adoption and
development of related technologies constitute the vision of the Regional
Technology Platform E3: Software Technologies and Knowledge Software (STKS)
focused on the Region of Central Macedonia.

MKLab in cooperation with the Central Administration Office of CERTH has developed a Strategic Research Agenda proposal for the Region of Central Macedonia. You can [download the Agenda](/files/SEA_final.pdf) (in Greek).
