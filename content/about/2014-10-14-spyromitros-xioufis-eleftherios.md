I hold a B.Sc. in Informatics, a M.Sc. in Information Systems and a Ph.D. in Machine Learning from the School of Informatics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH). Since January 2012 I work as a research associate at the Multimedia Knowledge and Social Media Analytics Laboratory of the Information Technologies Institute (CERTH-ITI) where I conduct research on various topics related to Machine Learning and Data Mining.
