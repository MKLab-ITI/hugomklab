<p>In the following playlist, some sample videos of anomaly detection from Ucsd dataset are provided. Rectangles depict regions of interest (ROIs) in which our algorithm is applied. Blue color contour is the default color of ROIs, while green contour reveals "anomalies" according to ground truth. Detected "anomalies" from our algorithm appear with red colored ROIs.<iframe allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYmmya8pZ9pUm4VlUEWGQf_v9Xcr8sCZb" width="560" frameborder="0" height="315"></iframe></p>
