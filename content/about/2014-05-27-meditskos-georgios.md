Since January 2012 he is working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the Information Technologies Institute (ITI) of the Center for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH). His research interests include Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in the Semantic Web (RDF/OWL, rule-based ontology reasoning, combination of rules and ontologies) and Semantic Web Services (discovery, composition). Recently, his research interests have focused on context-aware multi-sensor reasoning and fusion in Pervasive Environments and the development of semantic interpretation frameworks for the high-level integration, analysis and preservation of contextual information.</p>
