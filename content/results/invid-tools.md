The InVID tools are of interest for the task of video verification. In particular, the tools implement state-of-the-art and novel methods for the following tasks:

- logo detection in images and videos;
- context aggregation and analysis of videos;
- near-duplicate video retrieval.

All tools are accompanied by publicly available resources (e.g. reference datasets that can be used as benchmarks). More details are available on [this page](https://mklab.iti.gr/resources/invid/)
