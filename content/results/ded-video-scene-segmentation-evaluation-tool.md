<p>This is an implementation of the Differential Edit Distance (DED) metric, a unidimensional measure that has been developed to evaluate video scenes segmentation results. It compares the scene segmentation results of an automatic scene segmentation system with the ground-truth scene segmentation and estimates their similarity in terms of the number of shots that need to change scene in order to make the two segmentations identical. The software input is two .txt files containing the segmentation under comparison and the output is their distance, which can be also saved or appended in a .txt file. The software can be also used to compare any label strings that correspond to sets of well-ordered objects.</p><!--break--><p><strong>DOWNLOADS</strong></p><p>Version 1.0</p><p><a href="/files/ded/DED.zip">Windows 32-bit version</a></p><p><strong>PUBLICATION</strong><br />
