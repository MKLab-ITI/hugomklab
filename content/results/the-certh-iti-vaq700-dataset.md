<p align="justify" lang="zxx"><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p align="justify" lang="zxx"><span style="font-family: 'DejaVu Sans', sans-serif;">Our aim is to provide a comprehensive video dataset for the problem of aesthetic quality assessment consisting of user-created videos capturing moments of everyday life, such as excursions, school concerts, and training processes. We downloaded from YouTube 700 videos covering a variety of categories, such as outdoor activities, do it yourself videos, make up tutorials, lectures, and home-made videos, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution. The duration of each of these videos ranges from 1 to 6 minutes.</span></p>
<p align="justify" lang="zxx"><font face="DejaVu Sans, sans-serif">We conducted an annotation process that involved 12 annotators watching and evaluating the aesthetic value of these videos by assigning binary aesthetic quality ratings; 1 being assigned to videos of high aesthetic quality and 0 to videos of low aesthetic quality. Each video was assessed by 5 annotators. The final aesthetic score of each annotated video was calculated as the median score of the annotators' individual scores.&nbsp;</font><span style="font-family: 'DejaVu Sans', sans-serif;">As a result of the annotation process, 350 videos are rated as being of high aesthetic quality and another 350 as being of low aesthetic quality.</span></p>
<p align="justify" lang="zxx"><span style="font-family: 'DejaVu Sans', sans-serif;">A comprehensive representation scheme that exploits photo- and motion-based features, motivated by photography and cinematography rules, is also provided for this dataset.
