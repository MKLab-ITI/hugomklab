We make available a framework that contains Java implementations of the following topic detection methods:

- Document-pivot topic detection with LSH indexing.
- Graph-based feature-pivot topic detection with the use of the SCAN algorithm.
- Latent Dirichlter Allocation. In fact this is a wrapper around the mallet implementation.
- Soft frequent itemset mining.
- BNgram.
