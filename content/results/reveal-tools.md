The REVEAL tools are of interest for a number of applications related to news mining, social media retrieval and verification. In particular, the tools implement state-of-the-art and novel methods for the following tasks:

- image forensics;
- tweet verification;
- disturbing content detection;
- popularity prediction for reddit posts and YouTube videos;
- Twitter user classification;
- multimedia geotagging;
- social media summarization.

All tools are available as open source projects and in many cases they are accompanied by reference datasets that can be used as benchmarks. More details are available on [this page](https://mklab.iti.gr/resources/reveal/)
