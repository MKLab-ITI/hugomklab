<p>Heatmaps are graphical representations of matrix data with colors and comprise the most common presentation format of air quality and pollen concentration forecasts. In the context of evaluating the discovery of environmental portals, which include air quaity and pollen forecast data, based on heatmap recognition, CERTH-ITI has created two annotated sets of heatmaps.</p><!--break--><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The dataset &quot;A&quot; contains 2200 images extracted from web sites and from flickr. The dataset was manually annotated in order to perform evaluation experiments. Download the first heatmaps image database <a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/files/Heatmap_A_set_2200_images.zip">here</a>. The settings are available <a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/files/Heatmap_A_set_2200_images.xlsx">here</a>.<br />
