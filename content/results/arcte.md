This is a state-of-the-art method for producing graph embeddings that can be used for node classification.
ARCTE stands for Approximate Regularized Commute-Time Embedding.

It produces the graph embeddings through an improved implementation of personalized PageRank.
Additionally, a supervised feature weighting step is applied in order to further boost the importance of the framework.

The method and its associated study has been published on [PLOS One](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173347) and its implementation is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/reveal-graph-embedding).
An overview of its experimental results is available on [this page](https://mklab.iti.gr/resources/arcte/)
