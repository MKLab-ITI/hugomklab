<p><strong>EventSense datasets</strong></p>
<p>We make available two datasets from Twitter collected around the 53rd Thessaloniki International Film Festival (#tiff53) and the 14th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival (#tdf14). The datasets were collected using the respective hashtags during the two events and were then manually annotated with sentiment (+1, 0, -1 for positive, neutral and negative sentiment respectively). In addition, the #tiff53 dataset is also annotated with the film(s) associated with each tweet (if any). We believe that this is a real-world challenging dataset due to the fact that it comprises tweets in both English and Greek, and that the expressed sentiment is often hard to capture.</p>
