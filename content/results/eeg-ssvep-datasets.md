### 1. EEG SSVEP, 256-Channels, Single Stimulus (EGI - GES300)
**MAMEM EEG SSVEP Dataset I (256 channels, 11 subjects, 5 frequencies presented in isolation)**

EEG signals with 256 channels captured from 11 subjects executing a SSVEP-based experimental protocol. Five different frequencies (6.66, 7.50, 8.57, 10.00 and 12.00 Hz) have been used for the visual stimulation, and the EGI 300 Geodesic EEG System (GES 300), using a 256-channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net (HCGSN) and a sampling rate of 250 Hz has been used for capturing the signals.

### 2. EEG SSVEP, 256-Channels, Multiple Stimuli (EGI – GES300) 
**MAMEM EEG SSVEP Dataset II (256 channels, 11 subjects, 5 frequencies presented simultaneously)**

EEG signals with 256 channels captured from 11 subjects executing a SSVEP-based experimental protocol. Five different frequencies (6.66, 7.50, 8.57, 10.00 and 12.00 Hz) have been used for the visual stimulation, and the EGI 300 Geodesic EEG System (GES 300), using a 256-channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net (HCGSN) and a sampling rate of 250 Hz has been used for capturing the signals.

### 3. EEG SSVEP, 14-Channels, Multiple Stimuli (Emotive – EPOC+) 
**MAMEM EEG SSVEP Dataset III (14 channels, 11 subjects, 5 frequencies presented simultaneously)**

EEG signals with 14 channels captured from 11 subjects executing a SSVEP-based experimental protocol. Five different frequencies (6.66, 7.50, 8.57, 10.00 and 12.00 Hz) have been used for the visual stimulation, and the Emotiv EPOC, using 14 wireless channels has been used for capturing the signals.
