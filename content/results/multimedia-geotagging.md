The approach is a refined language model, including feature selection and weighting schemes and heuristic techniques that improves the accuracy in finer granularities. It is a text-based method, in which a complex geographical-tag model is built from the tags, titles and the locations of a massive amount of geotagged images that are included in a training set, in order to estimate the location of each query image included in a test set.
