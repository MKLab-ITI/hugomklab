<strong>Overview:</strong>
<p>Our aim is to provide a comprehensive image dataset consisting of undistorted, naturally-blurred and artificially-blurred images for image quality assessment purposes.</p><p>The CERTH image blur dataset consists of 2450 digital images, 1850 out of which are photographs captured by various camera models in different shooting conditions that have not been altered in any way following their capture. The remaining 600 are artificially-blurred images. For their creation 60 undistorted images were randomly selected and then several types of Gaussian, motion and circular averaging filters were applied to them.</p><p>The CERTH image blur dataset is organized as follows:</p><p><strong>Training set</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 630 undistorted images&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 220 naturally-blurred images</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 150 artificially-blurred images</p><p><strong>Evaluation set </strong>consisting of the &ldquo;natural blur&rdquo; set and of the &ldquo;artificial blur&rdquo; set.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Natural blur set</strong></p><p style="margin-left:36pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 589 undistorted images</p><p style="margin-left:36pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 411 naturally-blurred images</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Artificial blur set</strong></p><p style="margin-left:36pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30 undistorted images</p><p style="margin-left:36pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 450 artificially-blurred images</p><p><em>Download the CERTH image blur dataset and the corresponding ground-truth <a href="http://mklab.iti.gr/files/imageblur/CERTH_ImageBlurDataset.zip">here</a> .</em></p>
