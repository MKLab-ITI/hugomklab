<p>Social Event Detection (SED) in tagged photo collections</p><!--break--><p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Description</strong></span></p><p>This is a Java library implementing the framework presented by CERTH in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2012/sed2012/">Social Event Detection</a>&nbsp;task at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2012/">MediaEval 2012</a>. It can be used as a competing method for detecting events in large tagged photo collections.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Instructions</span></strong></p><p>1. Download the <a href="ftp://sed2012:111111@mklab.iti.gr/sed_exe.tar.gz">library</a> and <a href="ftp://sed2012:111111@mklab.iti.gr/mediaval_sed_essentials.tar.gz">auxiliary data</a> tar.gz archives. The library jar file contains all necessary dependencies (jars).</p><p>2. Preprocessing step:&nbsp;The preprocessing step aims to create the lists of candidate items for each item in the dataset based on&nbsp;time, location and visual and textual features.&nbsp;These candidates have already been computed and are placed under the candidates_per_item folder (zipped).&nbsp;Also in this step two global visual features are computed. Specifically for each image of the dataset a gist&nbsp;and vlad+surf descriptors are computed and stored into appropriate data structures (visual_features folder). &nbsp;</p><div id="cke_pastebin" style="position: absolute; left: -1000px; top: 191px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">&nbsp; &nbsp; and vlad+surf descriptors are computed and stored into aΞ&frac12; appropriatΞ&micro; data structure (visual_features folder). &nbsp;</div><div id="cke_pastebin" style="position: absolute; left: -1000px; top: 191px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">&nbsp; &nbsp; time, location and visual and textual features.&nbsp;</div><div id="cke_pastebin" style="position: absolute; left: -1000px; top: 191px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">&nbsp; &nbsp; These candidates have already &nbsp;computed and are placed under the candidates_per_item folder (zipped).&nbsp;</div><p>3. Learn same class model and create candidate events: This step may require a lot of time to be accomplished.</p><p>Command:&nbsp;java -jar sed.jar mediaeval.MediaEval &lt;/path/to/config.xml&gt;</p><p>In this step you have to specify the following set of parameters:</p><ul><li>training_set_folder: the folder contains the essentials for the training procedure</li><li>metadata_file: the xml file contains the metadata for each image of the dataset</li><li>codebook_file: a file contains the textual codebook, computed by the sed&#39;s dataset</li><li>visual_features_folder: the folder that contains the visual features (gist and vlad+surf)</li><li>candidates_per_item_folder: the folder that contains the nearest neighbors for each item in the dataset&nbsp;according to the various modalities</li><li>candidate_events_file: the output file which contains the candidate events (one event per line)</li></ul><p>4. Post processing:&nbsp;Merging and splitting of events based on time and location. Also, filtering of irrelevant events. &nbsp;</p><p>Command:&nbsp;java -jar sed.jar event.Events &lt;/path/to/config.xml&gt;</p><p>In this step you have to specify the following set of parameters: &nbsp;</p><ul><li>jaccard_similarity_threshold: similarity threshold beetwen an event and a concept&nbsp;</li><li>number_of_dominant_terms: number of dominant terms in the concept</li><li>output_folder: the output folder of the procedure</li><li>concept_terms_file: the file that contains terms relevant to the specific concept</li><li>general_terms_file: the file that contains a set of general terms&nbsp;challenge: 1, 2 or 3</li><li>splitting_time: split events that exceeds this time interval</li><li>include_single_items: true or false if we want to inlude single items as events</li><li>merge_events: true or false if we want to merge clusters of items into larger events</li><li>merging_time: merge events according to this time distance</li><li>bboxies: an array of bounding boxes used to filter out events irrelevant to these locations</li><li>gt_folder: the folder that contains the ground truth files</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Publication</strong></span></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 16px;">If you make use of this software for your research work, please cite the following paper:</span></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 10pt;">E.
