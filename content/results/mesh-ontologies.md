An Ontology Infrastructure for multimedia news analysis and representation has been made publicly available. This Ontology Infrastructure was developed within the MESH project and includes, among others, a Multimedia Information Object Ontology and a Domain Ontology; the former is based on the Information Object Design Pattern that extends the DOLCE core ontology, while the latter is based on an extension of the IPTC tree for news categorization.
