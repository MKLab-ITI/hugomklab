Provides the implementation of a topic detection framework developed for the MULTISENSOR project. In this framework, topic detection is tackled as a clustering problem and a hybrid clustering approach for assigning news articles into topics is realized. In this approach, prior knowledge of the correct number of clusters/topics is not required, as this number is automatically estimated by means of a novel methodology named DBSCAN-Martingale. The assignment of news articles into topics is done using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
