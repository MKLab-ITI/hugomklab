Stream Manager monitors a set of seven social streams : Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google+, Flickr, Tumblr and Youtube to collect incoming content relevant to a keyword, a user or a location, using the corresponding API that is supported from each service. Twitter API works as a real-time service, whereas the other six act as polling consumers perfoming requests to the network periodically. The framework also provides wrappers to a set of different storages.
