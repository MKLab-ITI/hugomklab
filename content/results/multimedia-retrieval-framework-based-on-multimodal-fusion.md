Contains the implementation of a multimedia retrieval framework developed for the MULTISENSOR project. The MULTISENSOR multimedia retrieval framework:

- fuses multiple modalities, so as to retrieve multimedia objects in response to a multimodal query;
- integrates high-level information, i.e. multimedia objects are enriched with high-level textual and visual concepts;
- is language-independent.
