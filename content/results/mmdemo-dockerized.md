This project dockerizes the multimedia demo that can be used for the collection of social media items from multiple sources. The only prerequisite is a machine with a running instance of Docker and Docker Compose. You can find a running instance of the demo in this link. It uses Docker Compose to buddle all the services into the same YAML file and makes easier the deployment of the application.
