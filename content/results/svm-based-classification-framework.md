<b>Associating Images with High-Level Semantic Concepts </b><br />
<br />
The SVM-based classification framework, which came up as a result of ITI's research activity on the knowledge-assisted multimedia analysis research field, supports the automatic image segmentation and semantic annotation at region level. Semantic annotation concerns the association of every image region with pre-defined high-level semantic concepts.

The examined image is initially segmented, using the algorithm proposed in [1], and the following MPEG-7 descriptors are extracted for every resulting region: Scalable Colour, Region Shape, Homogeneous Texture and Edge Histogram.<br />
<br />
The core functionality of the developed framework consists of a Support Vector Machines (SVMs) structure. Specifically, an individual SVM is introduced for every defined high-level concept to detect the corresponding instances based on the calculated low-level descriptors. Each SVM is trained under the â€˜one-against-all' approach.<br />
<br />
In the current stage of development, 27 high-level semantic concepts are supported: Natural-Person, Sailing-Boat, Sand, Building, Pavement, Road, Body-Of-Water, Cliff, Cloud, Mountain, Sea, Sky, Stone, Waterfall, Wave, Dried-Plant, Dried-Plant-Snowed, Foliage, Grass, Tree, Trunk, Snow, Sunset, Car, Ground, Lamp-Post, Statue.

An extension of the provided software, namely an ontology-based unified framework for realizing semantic image analysis and classification, has also been developed and is described in [2].<br />
