<p>There three datasets with annotated 'News Articles' web pages.<br>
	The first dataset (ArticlesNewsSitesData.7z) contains the URLs and the annotation for 1043 web pages/ articles retrieved from three well known sites with news (i.e. BBC, The Guardian, and Reuter). The web pages were annotated with the following four topics found in the IPTC news codes taxonomy: Economy-Business-Finance, Lifestyle-Leisure, Science-Technology, and Sports. It should be noted that the articles are classified to a single topic. If you use this dataset in your research, please cite the following article:<br>

<p>The second dataset (ArticlesNewsSitesData_2382.7z) contains the URLs and the annotation for 2382 web pages/ articles retrieved from several sites. The web pages were annotated with the following six topics found in the IPTC news codes taxonomy: Nature_Environment, Politics, Science_Technology, Economy-Business_Finance, Health and Lifestyle_leisure. It should be noted that the articles are classified to a single topic. If you use this dataset in your research, please cite the following article:<br>

<p>The third dataset (WikiRef_dataset.zip) contains more specific topics, which are references to specific Wikipedia webpages. The selected topics of the WikiRef220 dataset (and the number of articles per topic) are:<br>
