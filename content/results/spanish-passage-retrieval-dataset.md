<p><b>Description</b></p>
<p>
This dataset was created for evaluating the performance of passage retrieval. The task being modeled is that of a Spanish-speaking user with information needs on the subjects of ``baby care'', ``vaccination'', or ``low back pain'' in reputable health-related websites in Spanish and the system retrieves relevant short passages. 
The test collection contains 10,037 health-related Web documents in Spanish, 37 topics representing complex information needs formulated in a total of 167 natural language questions, and manual relevance assessments of text passages, pooled from multiple systems.
